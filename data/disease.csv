"H02108","Basal laminar drusen","Basal laminar drusen (BLD, also termed cuticular drusen or early adult onset grouped drusen) is an early-onset-drusen phenotype that shows a pattern of uniform small (25 to 75 micrometer), slightly raised, yellow subretinal nodules randomly scattered in the macula. In later stages, these drusen often become more numerous, with clustered groups of drusen scattered throughout the retina. It has been reported that a variant in CFH gene is strongly associated with this disease.","Nervous system disease"
"H00835","Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency","Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency, also known as 4-hydroxybutyric aciduria (4-HBA), is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism. Clinical features include intellectual disability with prominent deficits in expressive language, hypotonia, nonprogressive ataxia, and hyporeflexia. The causative gene is aldehyde dehydrogenase 5 family, member A1 (ALDH5A1) encoding SSADH. SSADH is deficient in affected individuals impairing the formation of succinic acid from succinic semialdehyde and leading to the increased production of 4-HBA.","Inherited metabolic disease"
"H00009","Adult T-cell leukemia","Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is one of the most aggressive hematologic malignancies and is caused by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). The HTLV-1 Tax protein has been demonstrated to be the oncogenic protein of the virus. Tax may contribute to the process of carcinogenesis by a variety of mechanisms, including upregulating the expression of cellular genes involved in T cell growth and proliferation, including IL-2, IL-2R-alpha, and IL-15. However, ATL cells do not always need Tax expression in the later stage of leukemogenesis. Genetic and epigenetic changes should be implicated in such multistep leukemogenesis. Regarding genetic changes, mutation of p53, and deletion of p16 have been reported in ATL. Mutations of Fas gene are also reported in patients with ATL cells. However, such genetic changes were not frequently detected. In this regard, epigenetic change of p16/INK4A gene was more frequent in ATL cells, and accumulated according to the disease progression. This finding suggests that epigenetic change, including DNA methylation, plays an important role in the leukemogenesis of ATL.","Cancer"
"H01913","Renpenning syndrome","Renpenning syndrome is a group of X-linked mental retardation syndromes, caused by mutations in human polyglutamine-binding protein 1 (PQBP1) gene. It is characterized by intellectual deficiency, microcephaly, short stature, and microrchidia. PQBP1 plays important roles in neurodevelopment and neuronal functions. It is thought to interact with RNA polymerase, transcription factors, and spliceosome proteins, and thus to act as a transcription and splicing regulator.","Congenital malformation"
"H01779","Neuroferritinopathy","Neuroferritinopathy is a rare autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in the ferritin light chain (FTL) gene leading to abnormal excessive iron accumulation in the brain, predominantly in the basal ganglia. Clinically, the disease presents as a chorea and dystonia. Clinical presentation may also include extrapyramidal and pyramidal tract signs as well as cerebellar ataxia, dysautonomia, cognitive decline, and psychiatric symptoms.","Neurodegenerative disease"
"H00499","Spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome","Spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by the malsegmentation of vertebrae and the fusion of carpal and tarsal bones.

"H00204","Infantile Refsum disease","Infantile Refsum disease (IRD) is an autosomal recessive peroxisome biogenesis disorder, whose clinical and biochemical features are different from the adult form of Refsum disease. IRD is characterized by delayed development, mental retardation, hepatomegaly, and skeletal changes.","Inherited metabolic disease"
"H00036","Osteosarcoma","Osteosarcoma is the most common type of primary bone cancer. Approximately 900 new cases of osteosarcoma are diagnosed each year in the United States. The presentation of this disease is bimodal, with peaks in adolescence and after the age of 50 years. The tumors typically arise in the metaphyseal regions of long bones, with the distal femur, proximal tibia, and proximal humerus representing the three most common sites. Genomic amplification, especially of both the p53-binding MDM2 gene and the flanking SAS gene, plays an important role in the biology of these tumors. Alterations of Rb1 and c-myc are also common, and mutations have been reported in p53, p16INK4A, and CDKN2B.","Cancer"
"H00452","Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome","Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome (BOS), also known as Osteopoikilosis, is a disorders characterized by increased bone density. Loss-of-function mutations in LEMD3, which encodes an inner nuclear membrane protein can result in these conditions. LEMD3 is thought to be involved in Smad signaling.","Congenital malformation"
"H01580","Vitamin C deficiency","Scurvy occurs because of reduced intake or absorption of vitamin C, which is characterized by bleeding gums, impaired wound healing, petechiae, perifollicular hemorrhage, anemia, arthralgia and joint effusions, fatigue, depression, and sudden death. It appears to result primarily from the decreased synthesis of collagen, a major protein in the body dependent on vitamin C for its biosynthesis. However, this role of vitamin C does not explain all of the manifestations associated with scurvy. At-risk groups include the poor (because of reduced access to groceries), food faddists, and individuals with purported allergies to multiple fruit and vegetable products. Other at-risk groups include persons with gastrointestinal disease (e.g. colitis), anatomical abnormalities, poor dentition, cancer patients on chemotherapy, patients on hemodialysis, and psychiatric disorders (e.g. depression, schizophrenia, or anorexia). Alcoholic persons represent one of the largest groups at risk for scurvy because they may have poorly balanced diets and because alcohol decreases the absorption of vitamin C. The diagnosis of scurvy is generally based on clinical features and dietary history, and there is rapid resolution of signs and symptoms after vitamin C supplementation.","Hematologic disease; Cardiovascular disease; Metabolic disease"
"H02305","RERE-related neurodevelopmental syndrome","RERE-related neurodevelopmental syndrome, also known as neurodevelopmental disorder with or without anomalies of the brain, eye, or heart (NEDBEH), is a rare autosomal dominant disorder.

It is characterised by chorioretinopathy, pituitary dysfunction, childhood onset of ataxia, and spastic paraplegia. Polydactyly and renal disease are absent. So it is distinct from Bardet-Biedl syndrome.","Nervous system disease"
"H00660","Congenital contractural arachnodactyly","Congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA) or Beals syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by a Marfan-like appearance and arachnodactyly. Most affected individuals have 'crumpled' ears, contractures of major joints, and camptodactyly. Additional features include muscular hypoplasia and scoliosis. In contrast to Marfan syndrome, CCA does not affect the aorta or the eyes.","Congenital malformation"
"H01574","Familial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification","Familial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification, also known as Fahr disease, is an inherited neurological disorder characterized by symmetrical calcification of cerebral structures lacking known metabolic causes such as calcium or phosphorus homeostasis disorders. Currently, autosomal dominant and recessive causative genes have been identified.","Nervous system disease"
"H00694","Dent disease","Dent disease is a renal tubular disorder characterized by manifestations of proximal tubule dysfunction, including low-molecular-weight proteinuria, hypercalciuria, nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, and progressive renal failure. The disease is caused by mutations in either the CLCN5 or OCRL1 genes. CLCN5 encodes a member of the ClC family of chloride ion channels and ion transporters. OCRL1 encodes a phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) 5-phosphatase and mutations are also associated with Lowe Syndrome.","Urinary system disease"
"H01746","STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy","STING (stimulator of interferon genes)-associated basculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI) is a rare hereditary autoinflammatory disorder caused by gain-of-function mutations in TMEM173, the gene encoding the STING protein. It is considered that the mutations in the TMEM173 gene confer constitutive activation of STING and hypersensitivity to ligand stimulation, resulting in chronic activation of the STING-interferon pathway. Patients with SAVI have severe neonatal-onset small vessel vasculitis, which is expressed by telangiectatic ulcerative rashes in the limbs, earlobes, or nose, leading to microangiopathic thrombosis, vessel occlusion, and even risk of gangrene. Some SAVI patients may present chronic interstitial lung disease, which can be severe and lethal.","Immune system disease"
"H01322","Kyasanur Forest disease","Kyasanur Forest disease is a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by Kyasanur Forest disease (KFDV), a flavivirus in the Flaviviridae family of +ssRNA viruses, and transmitted by Ixodoidea ticks. KFDV was first isolated 1957 in India.","Infectious disease"
"H01110","Pneumothorax","Pneumothorax is defined as air or gas accumulated in the pleural space and can be classified as spontaneous or traumatic. Traumatic pneumothorax includes iatrogenic cases caused during procedures such as pacemaker insertion. Spontaneous pneumothorax can be subclassified as primary or secondary. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP), which is defined as a pneumothorax without underlying lung disease, predominantly occurs in young, thin males. It is usually caused by ruptured pleural blebs or bullae. Approximately 10% of patients with PSP have a positive family history. Gene mutations in folliculin (FLCN) have been found.","Respiratory disease"

It is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, and is characterized by absence of granulocytes and almost complete deficiency of lymphocytes in peripheral blood, hypoplasia of the thymus and secondary lymphoid organs, and lack of innate and adaptive humoral and cellular immune functions, leading to fatal septicemia within days after birth. The bone marrow showed a maturation arrest in the myeloid and lymphoid lineage. The underlying genetic defect for most cases of RD have been identified in the gene encoding adenylate kinase 2 (AK2).","Immune system disease"
"H00832","Core neuroacanthocytosis syndromes","Neuroacanthocytosis (NA) syndromes are a heterogeneous group of diseases in which nervous system abnormalities coincide with red blood cell acanthocytosis. Core NA syndromes are one of the broad groups of NA disorders characterized by degeneration of the basal ganglia, movement disorders, cognitive impairment, and psychiatric features. NA syndromes are caused by disease-specific genetic mutations. The mechanism by which these mutations cause neurodegeneration is not known.","Nervous system disease"
"H00658","Syndromic X-linked mental retardation","X-linked mental retardation (MRX) is an inherited condition that causes failure to develop cognitive abilities because of mutations in several genes on the X chromosome. XLMR is subdivided into syndromic and non-syndromic forms, depending on whether further abnormalities are found or not.

"H00693","Ichthyosis bullosa of Siemens","Ichthyosis Bullosa of Siemens (IBS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by mild hyperkeratosis and blister formation. The blistering is superficial, and areas of peeling of the skin are known as the 'Mauserung phenomenon'. IBS shows similar features to those in epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, but can be distinguished by the absence of erythema.","Congenital malformation"
"H01741","Autoinflammation lipodystrophy and dermatosis syndrome","Autoinflammation lipodystrophy and dermatosis syndrome (ALDD) is a systemic inflammatory condition characterized by recurrent episodes of fever, cutaneous lesions, lipodystrophy, and visceral inflammatory manifestations. In 2011, several studies showed that a number of disorders referred to as joint contractures, muscle atrophy, microcytic anemia, and panniculitis-induced lipodystrophy (JMP) syndrome, Nakajo-Nishimura syndrome, Japanese autoinflammatory syndrome with lipodystrophy (JASL), and chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperature (CANDLE) syndrome are caused by mutations in proteasome subunit beta type 8 (PSMB8) gene, indicating that these disorders are disease phenotypes along the same disease spectrum. Key symptoms include a persistent fever (higher than 38.5 degrees Celsius), steroid-sensitive erythema nodosum-like (edematous and purpuric) plaques, long clubbed fingers, hyperhidrosis, myositis, hepatosplenomegaly, macroglossia, facial and limbs lipoatrophy, and developmental (height, weight, and IQ) retardation. Skin biopsies show immature myeloid-lineage cells with mitoses. Some patients may have joint contracture, auricular and nasal chondritis, and calcification of the basal ganglia. Acute cardiovascular event is the leading cause of death in these patients for whom life expectancy is notably reduced. Management of these patients is by palliative care. The need for steroids is very high even in combination with anti IL-1, anti IL-6 or anti-TNF treatments.","Immune system disease"
"H01573","Zimmermann-Laband syndrome","Zimmermann-Laband syndrome (ZLS) is a rare craniofacial malformation syndrome with predominant intraoral involvement consisting in diffuse gingival fibromatosis of early onset. Most cases are sporadic, suggesting autosomal dominant inheritance with de novo mutations. The main clinical characteristics of ZLS are gingival enlargement, prominent nose and thick ears with soft cartilages, nail aplasia or hypoplasia, hypertrichosis, joint hyperextensibility, hepato(spleno)megaly, and intellectual disability with or without epilepsy. Mutations in KCNH1 and ATP6V1B2 account for a proportion of ZLS.","Congenital malformation"

The clinical phenotype is variable, and some MLIII patients survive to adulthood. MLIII is caused by the deficiency of GlcNac-1-phosphotransferase, that is exists as a heterohexamer comprising three subunits, alpha, beta, and gamma. It is encoded by two distinct genes, GNPTAB and GNPTAG.","Congenital disorder of metabolism"
"H00667","Woolly hair","Woolly hair (WH) is a group of hair shaft dystrophies characterized by fine and tightly curled hair. WH is inherited in either autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive manner. Autosomal recessive woolly hair can also show varying degrees of sparse hair or hypotrichosis (HYPT).","Congenital malformation"
"H00455","Spinal muscular atrophy","Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disease characterized by degeneration of motor neurons, resulting in progressive muscle atrophy and paralysis. The most common form of SMA is caused by mutations of the SMN gene, that encodes the SMN protein, which regulates snRNP assembly. Four types of SMA are recognized depending on the age of onset and the severity of the disease: type I (Werdning-Hoffman), type II (intermediate), type III (Kugeleberg-Welander) and type IV (adult form). Other forms of spinal muscular atrophy are caused by mutation of other genes, some known and others not yet defined.","Neurodegenerative disease"
"H01587","Disseminated intravascular coagulation","Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is an acquired syndrome characterised by the intravascular activation of coagulation with loss of localisation arising from different causes. It can originate from and cause damage to the microvasculature, which if sufficiently severe, can produce organ dysfunction. DIC is not a disease entity on itself but is always associated to an underlying disease. The clinical conditions that may be associated with DIC include sepsis, trauma, malignancy, liver disease, obstetric disorders, envenomation, vascular anomalies, and major transfusion reactions. A diagnosis of DIC should be made only in the presence of a clinical condition (causative factor) supported by repeated laboratory tests for coagulation profile and clotting factors. Treatment of DIC is aimed at combating the underlying disorder followed by supportive management.","Hematologic disease"
"H02302","Hepatoblastoma","Although malignant tumors of the liver are rare during childhood, hepatoblastoma is the most common liver cancer in children, usually diagnosed during the first 3 years of life. These tumors are thought to arise from hepatic progenitors or hepatoblasts. The most frequent genetic aberrations (70-90%) in hepatoblastoma occur in genes involved in the Wnt signaling pathway. The Wnt signaling pathway is activated often by acquired activating mutations of the beta-catenin (CTNNB1) gene, and less commonly through constitutional mutations of the APC gene or somatic mutations of other genes in the pathway.","Cancer"
"H00031","Breast cancer","Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that originate from cells lining the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland. The molecular subtypes of breast cancer, which are based on the presence or absence of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone subtypes) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), include: hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative (luminal A subtype), hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive (luminal B subtype), hormone receptor negative and HER2 positive (HER2 positive), and hormone receptor negative and HER2 negative (basal-like or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs)). Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Somatic mutations in only three genes (TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3) occurred at >10% incidence across all breast cancers.","Cancer"
"H00203","Acatalasemia","Acatalasia is an autosomal recessive peroxisomal disorder caused by deficiency of erythrocyte catalase that metabolizes both hydrogen peroxide and a variety of substrates such as ethanol, methanol, phenol and nitrites. Catalase has an important protective function against the toxic effects of peroxides generated in peroxisomes and removes them with high efficiency. The Japanese, Swiss, and Hungarian types of acatalasemia display differences in biochemical and genetic aspects. Takahara's disease shows progressive oral gangrene and formerly occurred in about half of Japanese acatalasemia patients.","Congenital disorder of metabolism"
"H01922","Infantile hypotonia with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies","Infantile hypotonia with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies (IHPRF) is an autosomal-recessive syndrome characterized by subtle facial dysmorphism, variable degrees of hypotonia, speech impairment, chronic constipation, and intellectual disability. It is caused by mutations in the cation channel NALCN and UNC80. NALCN has a role in basal sodium ion leak conductance in neurons, essential for neuronal function. UNC80 bridges between UNC79 and NALCN. Recently, pathogenic biallelic variants in TBC1-domain-containing kinase (TBCK) were also identified.","Congenital malformation"
"H01748","Autoinflammation with infantile enterocolitis","Autoinflammation with infantile enterocolitis (AIFEC) is a rare autosomal dominant disease characterized by neonatal-onset enterocolitis, periodic fever, and fatal/near-fatal episodes of autoinflammation. It was shown that the disease is caused by gain-of-function mutations in NLRC4. NLRC4 protein is known to directly assemble inflammasomes that activate IL-1beta and IL-18.","Immune system disease"
"H02139","Autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets","Autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets (ARHR) is a rare form of hypophosphatemic rickets that is caused by mutations in the DMP1 gene. DMP1 is highly expressed in mineralized tissues, especially in osteoblasts and osteocytes, and is a key regulatory protein that is required for the normal growth and development of bone, cartilage and dentin. Recently, ARHR associated with a mutation in the ENPP1 gene has also been reported.","Congenital disorder of metabolism"
"H00804","Multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomata","Multiple cutaneous and uterine leiomyomatosis (MCUL) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder that affects both sexes. It is characterized by benign skin tumors arising from the arrector pili muscle, and from uterine fibroids in female patients. Some patients with MCUL develop renal cancer and this condition is called hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer.","Cancer"
"H00038","Melanoma","Melanoma is a form of skin cancer that has a poor prognosis and which is on the rise in Western populations. Melanoma arises from the malignant transformation of pigment-producing cells, melanocytes. The only known environmental risk factor is exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light and in people with fair skin the risk is greatly increased. Melanoma pathogenesis is also driven by genetic factors. Oncogenic NRAS mutations activate both effector pathways Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt. The Raf-MEK-ERK pathway may also be activated via mutations in the BRAF gene. The PI3K-Akt pathway may be activated through loss or mutation of the inhibitory tumor suppressor gene PTEN. These mutations arise early during melanoma pathogenesis and are preserved throughout tumor progression. Melanoma development has been shown to be strongly associated with inactivation of the p16INK4a/cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6/retinoblastoma protein (p16INK4a/CDK4,6/pRb) and p14ARF/human double minute 2/p53 (p14ARF/HMD2/p53) tumor suppressor pathways. MITF and TP53 are implicated in further melanoma progression.","Cancer"
"H01777","Schwartz-Jampel syndrome","Schwartz-Jampel syndrome (SJS) is a rare hereditary disorder with joint contractures, generalized myotonia, skeletal anomalies, and facial dysmorphism. Schwartz-Jampel syndrome (SJS) is a term now applied to 2 different autosomal recessive disorder, sometimes termed SJS type 1 and SJS type 2. SJS type 1 results from mutations in the HSPG2 gene, which encodes perlecan, a major component of basement membranes. It exhibits muscle stiffness, mild muscle weakness, and a number of minor morphological abnormalities. In affected patients, problems with motor development frequently become evident during the first year of life. SJS type 2, also known as Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome [DS:H00462], is a genetically distinct disorder with a more severe phenotype.","Nervous system disease; Musculoskeletal disease"
"H01545","O'nyong-nyong fever","O'nyong-nyong fever is an infectious disease caused by O'nyong-nyong virus (ONNV), an alphavirus in the Togaviridae family of +ssRNA viruses, and transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes. ONNV was first isolated in 1959 in Uganda.","Infectious disease"
"H00497","Cherubism","Cherubism is an uncommon disorder of the jaws in childhood. The maxillary bones are replaced with pseudocystic osteolytic lesions, affecting dentition. Mutated SH3BP2, which can enhance BCR signaling, is involved in the pathogenesis of cherubism.","Digestive system disease"

SCOT/OXCT1 is a key mitochondrial enzyme in the metabolism of ketone bodies in various organs. Deficiency of SCOT activity inhibits peripheral ketone body utilization and causes episodes of severe ketoacidosis.","Inherited metabolic disease"
"H01313","Escherichia coli meningitis","Escherichia coli meningitis is a bacterial meningitis caused by Escherichia coli, and is common in the newborn within the first month of life (neonatal meningitis). Neonatal meningitis-associated Escherichia coli (NMEC) strains possessing the K1 capsular polysaccharide is a major cause of neonatal meningitis.","Infectious disease"
"H00007","Hodgkin lymphoma","Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is one of the most frequent lymphomas in the Western world and often affects young adults. HL is subdivided into classical and nodular lymphocyte-predominant forms. About 95% of cases are classical HL, and 5% are nodular lymphocyte-predominant HL (NLPHL). A characteristic feature of HL is the rareness of the tumor cells, which are called Hodgkin's and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) cells in classical HL and lymphocytic and histiocytic (L&H) cells in NLPHL. These cells represent only about 1% of the cellular infiltrate, while the vast majority of infiltrating cells are T lymphocytes, histiocytes, eosinophilic granulocytes and plasma cells. HRS cells show constitutive activity of both the classical and alternative NF-{kappa}B signalling pathways, which is probably a major pathogenetic mechanism in Hodgkin's lymphoma. The NF-{kappa}B activity in HRS cells is probably mediated by diverse mechanisms: receptor signalling through CD40, RANK, BCMA, and TACI, genomic REL amplification, destructive mutations in IKBA and IKBE. In HL pathogenesis associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection, the activation of NF-{kappa}B is induced by viral latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1).","Cancer"

"H01783","Ebstein anomaly","Ebstein anomaly is a rare congenital heart abnormality, characterized by downward displacement of the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. Displacement and malformation of the tricuspid valve is accompanied by an enlarged right atrium and a dilated, thinned right ventricle. Ebstein anomaly can occur as a sporadic or a familial defect. It has been reported that deletion 1p36 and deletion 8p23.1 are the most frequent chromosomal structural changes associated with Ebstein anomaly.","Developmental disorder; Cardiovascular disease"
"H00651","Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia","Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED) is a condition characterized by major involvement of ectodermal structures with perturbed formation and maturation of teeth, hair, and sweat glands. HED is caused by defective epithelial-mesenchymal interaction that involves the Ectodysplasin/Edar/Edaradd signaling pathway. Congenital anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia is a sex-linked disorder characterized by incomplete development of the dermis, resulting in the absence of hair follicles and sweat glands with anodontia in affected males.","Congenital malformation"
"H02106","Genetic obesity","Obesity predisposes to many diseases. It has a very heterogeneous phenotypic expression and the molecular mechanisms involved in its development are diverse. Although environmental factors are important, genes also have a significant role in its pathogenesis. Several genes that are involved in monogenic, syndromic and polygenic obesity, have been identified.","Endocrine and metabolic disease"
"H02334","Pierpont syndrome","Pierpont syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by developmental delay, characteristic facial gestalt, hearing loss, and abnormal fat distribution in the distal limbs.

This disease links to autosomal recessive mutations in KCNJ10, which encodes the potassium channel.","Nervous system disease"
"H00669","Naxos disease","Naxos disease is characterized by cardiomyopathy, palmoplantar keratoderma, and woolly hair. Cardiac manifestation in patients with Naxos disease is arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy that appears by adolescence.","Congenital malformation"
"H01589","Systemic primary carnitine deficiency","Systemic primary carnitine deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by cardiomyopathy, muscle weakness, hypoglycemic hypoketotic coma, and hyperammonemia. Carnitine plays essential roles in the transportation of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation. This disease is caused by mutations in SLC22A5 that encodes the high-affinity sodium-dependent carnitine transporter, organic cation transporter 2 (OCTN2). The hallmark of systemic primary carnitine deficiency is low concentrations of carnitine in plasma, with accumulation of lipid deposits and renal leakage of carnitine. The clinical symptoms are alleviated dramatically by oral administration of L-carnitine. However, if untreated, patients are precipitated into a crisis with cardiac arrest or Reye-like syndrome that includes acute encephalopathy and fatty degenerative liver failure.","Congenital disorder of metabolism"
"H01925","Transient neonatal zinc deficiency","Transient neonatal zinc deficiency (TNZD) is a disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations of the zinc transporter SLC30A2/ZnT2 gene, which results in low zinc breast milk in the mother, consequently causing zinc deficiency in the breast-fed infant. The main initial symptoms of zinc deficiency are dermatitis, diarrhea, alopecia, and loss of appetite. Currently, at least two zinc transporters from separate protein families are now known to be involved in the genetics of zinc deficiency. One is SLC39A4/ZIP4, which mutations can cause acrodermatitis enteropathica (AEZ) [DS:H00212] with autosomal recessive inheritance. The other one is SLC30A2/ZnT2, the transporter responsible for supplying human milk with zinc. Mutations in this transporter cause TNZD with symptoms similar to AE but with autosomal dominant inheritance. The two diseases can be distinguished in affected infants. AE is fatal if zinc is not supplied to the infant after weaning, whereas TNZD is a genetic defect of the mother limiting the supply of zinc in the milk, and therefore the infant usually will obtain enough zinc once weaned. Furthermore, the mothers' blood zinc levels are normal, and zinc supplementation to the mother's diet fails to improve the zinc levels in the breast milk.","Skin and connective tissue disease; Gastrointestinal disease"
"H01119","Prolidase deficiency","Prolidase deficiency (PD) is a severe autosomal recessive disorder due to the lack of prolidase (EC:3.4.13.9), a peptidase with a preference for Xaa-Pro dipeptide substrates that participates in collagen metabolism and in the terminal degradation of endogenous and dietary proteins. It typically begins in childhood and common symptoms include chronic intractable skin ulcerations and mental retardation. Mutations in prolidase gene causing the reduction or the loss of prolidase activity are responsible for PD.","Inherited metabolic disease"
"H02333","Laurin-Sandrow syndrome","Laurin-Sandrow syndrome (LSS) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by polysyndactyly of hands and/or feet, mirror image duplication of the feet, and nasal defects. It has been shown that small microduplications within the ZRS region are the underlying genetic cause of LSS. ZRS is highly conserved in all vertebrates with limb appendages and consists of an 800bp enhancer sequence located within intron 5 of LMBR1.","Congenital malformation"

The main clinical symptoms of this disorder are the huge increase in plasma trigriceride and cholesterol, and the presence of xanthomatous eruption, lipemia retinalis, hepatosplenomegaly, and the complication of acute pancreatitis. The genetic basis for primary hyperchylomicronemia is heterogeneous. The familial chylomicronemia (known as Fredrickson's classification of type 1 hyperlipoproteinemia) [DS:H00154] is a clinical condition showing the severest hypertriglyceridemia and is classically represented by two rare genetic disorders, i.e., familial lipoprotein lipase (LPL) deficiency and familial apolipoprotein C-II deficiency. Even rarer conditions such as circulating inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase and the presence of autoantibodies also cause type 1 hyperlipoproteinemia. More recently, patients with primary hyperchylomicronemia caused by mutations in the gene for glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high density lipoprotein-binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1) or lipase maturation factor 1 (LMF1). By contrast, the more commonly encountered polygenic chylomicronemia of adulthood, referred to as mixed dyslipidemia (known as type 5 hyperlipoproteinemia) [DS:H00157], can present later in life and is characterized by increased levels of hepatically derived triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and triglyceride-rich remnant particles together with reduced levels of HDL cholesterol.","Inherited metabolic disease; Cardiovascular disease"

DDSH is caused by a functional null mutation of perlecan gene (HSPG2).","Congenital malformation"
"H00602","Glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (GRA)","Glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (GRA), also known as familial hypoaldosteronism type I, is an autosomal dominant disease that causes hypertension, hypokalemia, decreased plasma renin activity and increased aldosterone levels. GRA is caused by a chimeric gene that links the 11 [beta]-hydroxylase promoter sequence to the aldosterone synthase gene's coding region. As a result, aldosterone is ectopically synthesized in the cortisol-secreting zona fasciculata of the adrenal gland under the control of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH). The high levels of mineralocorticoids activate the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and upregulate Na reabsorption and K secretion. Most individuals have severe hypertension since infancy but milder phenotypes have been described.","Endocrine disease"

IAHSP is allelic to juvenile amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (JALS) [DS:H00058] and juvenile primary lateral sclerosis (JPLS) [DS:H00970]. IAHSP can be distinguished from those two disorders by the association of an infantile onset, at the age of walking achievement, with an ascending progression during childhood but a long survival during adulthood.","Nervous system disease"
"H00292","Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy","Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a primary myocardial disorder with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance that is characterized by hypertrophy of the left ventricles with histological features of myocyte hypertrophy, myfibrillar disarray, and interstitial fibrosis. HCM is one of the most common inherited cardiac disorders, with a prevalence in young adults of 1 in 500. Hundreds of mutations in the genes that encode protein constituents of the sarcomere have been identified in HCM. These mutations increase the Ca2+ sensitivity of cardiac myofilaments. Increased myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity is expected to increase the ATP utilization by actomyosin at submaximal Ca2+ concentrations, which might cause an imbalance in energy supply and demand in the heart under severe stress. The inefficient use of ATP suggests that an inability to maintain normal ATP levels could be the central abnormality. This theory might be supported by the discovery of the role of a mutant PRKAG2 gene in HCM, which in active form acts as a central sensing mechanism protecting cells from depletion of ATP supplies. The increase in the myfilament Ca2+ sensitivity well account for the diastolic dysfunction of model animals as well as human patients of HCM. It has been widely proposed that left ventricular hypertrophy is not a primary manifestation but develops as compensatory response to sarcomere dysfunction.","Cardiovascular disease"

The disease manifestations are protean ranging from high fever, arthralgia, skin rash, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly accompanied by systemic manifestations. Complications of AOSD include transient pulmonary hypertension, macrophage activation syndrome, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and amyloidosis. Common laboratory abnormalities include neutrophilic leukocytosis, abnormal liver function tests, and elevated acute-phase reactants (ESR, CRP, ferritin). The exact pathogenesis of AOSD is unknown. Several factors such as genetics, infectious (bacterial and viral) agents, and environmental factors have been thought to play a causative role. Although no familial trend has been reported in AOSD, some studies have reported an association between AOSD and gene polymorphism of HLA, IL-18, and MEFV. Recent advances have revealed a pivotal role of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-18 in disease pathogenesis. Treatment consists of anti-inflammatory medications. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have limited efficacy, and corticosteroid therapy and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs are usually required.","Immune system disease"

"H01529","Avascular necrosis of femoral head","Avascular necrosis of the femoral head (ANFH) is one of the most common diseases of osteonecrosis that leads to destruction of the hip joint. Osteonecrosis is a pathological process in which cellular death in the bone constituents occurs because of decreased blood flow or an interruption in the blood supply. ANFH occurs mainly in young individuals between 30 and 50 years old. The clinical manifestations of ANFH, including pain on exertion, limping gait, and discrepancy in leg length, cause considerable disability. The etiology of ANFH is unknown, but previous studies have indicated that heritable thrombophilia and hypofibrinolysis, alcohol intake, and steroid use are risk factors for ANFH. Most cases are sporadic, but familial cases have been described. It has been reported Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (LCPD) is a particular type of femoral head necrosis occurring in children. It is more common among boys, and bilateral involvement occurs in 8-24% of cases. The disease is usually diagnosed among children under age 14 years, with a peak onset between 5 and 8 years of age. There is delayed skeletal maturation and impaired growth. In addition to congenital abnormalities, LCPD is associated with greater risk of cardiovascular diseases and diseases of the blood. Most cases are sporadic, but familial cases have been described. It has been reported that COL2A1 mutations are associated with this disease. Recent studies have suggested that an association exists between ANFH and genetic polymorphisms in the plasminogen activator inhibitor (SERPINE1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3), and P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) genes.","Musculoskeletal disease"

Gain-of-function mutations in the proto-oncogene c-kit that induce constitutive kinase activity of its product, KIT protein, are characteristic of various neoplastic diseases including MCL. Downstream signaling pathways, including PI3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT, are inappropriately activated, and this is believed to contribute to the abnormal proliferation and survival of these neoplastic cells. The reason why the prognosis of patients with MCL is mostly that MCs in these patients are largely resistant against conventional drugs and targeted drugs, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) directed against KIT D816V such as PKC412 (midostaurin).","Cancer"
"H02394","Cleft palate, cardiac defects, and mental retardation","Cleft palate, cardiac defects, and mental retardation (CPCMR) is characterized by atrial or ventricular septal defects, cleft palate, and variable developmental delays and intellectual disability.

"H01723","Deep vein thrombosis","Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is the formation of blood clots (thrombi) in the deep veins. It can lead to complications such as postphlebitic syndrome, pulmonary embolism and death. DVT has genetic and acquired risk factors. The genetic risk factors can be subdivided into those that are strong, moderate and weak. Strong risk factors are deficiencies of antithrombin, protein C and protein S. Moderately strong are factor V Leiden, prothrombin 20210A, non-O blood group and fibrinogen 10034T. There are many weak genetic risk factors, including fibrinogen, factor XIII and factor XI variants. Acquired risk factors include surgery, oral contraceptives, trauma, obesity, cancer, and so on. In some patients, venous thrombosis occurs in the presence of such risk factors for DVT. These patients are classified as having secondary DVT. In the other patients, no predisposing factors are found, and thus, are considered as having an idiopathic DVT.","Hematologic disease"
"H00295","Viral myocarditis","Myocarditis is clinically defined as cardiac disease associated with inflammation of the myocardium and necrosis and/or degeneration of adjacent myocytes in the absence of an ischemic event. Most often, myocarditis results from common viral infections; less commonly, specific forms of myocarditis may result from other pathogens, toxic or hypersensitivity drug reactions, giant-cell myocarditis, or sarcoidosis. More than 20 common viruses, including coxsackieviruses, adenoviruses, influenza viruses, cytomegaloviruses, and human immunodeficiency virus, have been associated with myocarditis in humans. However, coxsackieviruses are considered the dominant cause of myocarditis, particularly in neonates and young children. After the acute phase caused by direct cytopathic effects of the virus, a small proportion of patients subsequently develop autoimmune- mediated, chronic myocarditis [4], accompanied by circulating autoantibodies to cardiac myosin and other heart antigens, which can sometimes lead to heart failure and death associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Genetic linkage between susceptibility to myocarditis/DCM and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes has been reported in both humans and experimentally induced mouse models.","Cardiovascular disease"

Firstly, Staphylococcus lugdunensis is a most unusual coagulase-negative staphylococcus found on the human skin. It can cause infections at many sites including superficial skin infections, bacteremia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and breast abscess. Endocarditis caused by S. lugdunensis can lead to substantial morbidity and mortality. Secondly, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, found among the normal skin flora, is commonly isolated from the axillae, perineum, and inguinal areas of humans and causes septicemia, peritonitis, otitis, and urinary tract infections. S. haemolyticus is notorious for its multidrug resistance and historically early acquisition of resistance to methicillin and glycopeptide antibiotics. Finally, Staphylococcus pseudintermedius is an important opportunistic pathogen of dogs and cats. S. pseudintermedius colonization is very uncommon in humans. It is rarely isolated from human dog-bite wounds. The infection has been associated with wide range of symptoms such as bacteremia, a brain abscess, and pneumonia.","Infectious disease"

Non-syndromic forms are responsible for 70% of the cases of hereditary etiology and syndromic cases represent 30% of them. Among the forms of heritage, autosomal-recessive inheritance is the most frequent one (75%-85%), followed by autosomal- dominant inheritance (12-13%) and X-linked or mitochondrial, with 2-3% of the cases of non-syndromic hearing loss. The autosomal-recessive forms of deafness are generally the most severe and are almost exclusively caused by cochlear defects (sensorineural deafness), in contrast to the syndromic forms of deafness, where the hearing loss in most cases is conductive (external and/or middle ear developmental defects) or mixed.","Nervous system disease"

It is generally understood that abnormal cardiovascular development during embryogenesis may be attributed to an aberrant biological process that is heterogeneous and complex, with both environmental and genetic risk factors involved.","Congenital malformation"
"H00408","Type 1 diabetes mellitus","The majority of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) cases are believed to arise from an inflammatory, autoimmune attack against the beta cells in the pancreas, which consequently leads to the failure of insulin-mediated blood glucose regulation in the body. T1DM signs and symptoms can come on quickly and may include increased thirst and frequent urination, fatigue, weight loss and so on. It is recognized that both genetic and environmental determinants are important in defining disease risk. The HLA class II genes are most strongly associated with T1DM. Another plausible candidate genes are INS, CTLA4 and PTPN22.

"H00091","T-B+Severe combined immunodeficiency","Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) comprises a heterogeneous group of monogenic disorders that result in early-onset severe infections by a range of pathogens (such as bacteria, viruses and fungi). Typically, patients with SCID have a severe defect in T-cell differentiation, along with direct or indirect impairment of B-cell development and function. SCIDs with lack of circulating T cells but a normal number of B cells accounts for 30 to 50% of all cases of human SCIDs. The most frequent form of SCID, X-linked SCID (SCID-X1), is caused by mutations in the gamma-chain-encoding gene. Gamma-chain is a common subunit shared by several cytokine receptors. It results in an absence of both mature T lymphocytes and NK lymphocytes. The second most common variant is autosomal recessive and due to mutations of the JAK3 gene. IL-7R alpha gene mutations result in a pure T-cell deficiency. Rare cases of SCID consisting of pure T-cell deficiencies have been attributed to defects in key proteins involved in pre-TCR/TCR signaling. Deficiency in the CD45 phosphatase has been reported in two cases of SCID, while defects in CD3 delta, CD3 epsilon and CD zeta have also been described.","Primary immunodeficiency"
"H01527","Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy","Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is a polyneuropathy that is often disabling, with more than 50% of patients reported as having temporary disability, and about 10% eventually becoming persistently disabled. The core clinical features are a chronic progressive or relapsing and remitting, symmetrical, and sensory and motor polyradiculoneuropathy causing weakness of proximal and distal muscles. The etiology is suspected to be of autoimmune origin, and the diagnosis is typically based on clinical history, neurologic examination, electrophysiologic studies, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies, and pathologic examination. CIDP often responds to immune therapies including corticosteroids, plasma exchange, and high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg).","Immune system disease; Nervous system disease"

FHF is with the basic definition of the onset of hepatic encephalopathy within 8 weeks of the appearance of the first symptoms like jaundice, fever, nausea, and vomiting. The prothrombin time is prolonged by 4-6 seconds or more. While the etiologies of FHF are multiple and varied, viral hepatitis is the most frequent cause. Around 40-60% of patients with FHF are thought to be due to some viral infection. The prognosis is dependent on several factors, including the underlying cause of liver failure. For instance, it is well known that the spontaneous recovery rates from FHF from such etiologies as hepatitis A and acetaminophen toxicity are high, whereas those same rates for other types of viral hepatitis and idiosyncratic drug reactions are quite low. Identification of the cause of FHF is important because some causes have specific treatment interventions or antidotes. Specific therapies include N-acetylcysteine for acetaminophen overdose, and acyclovir for herpesvirus infection. Different therapeutic options such as complete exchange blood transfusion, corticosteroids, and plasma pheresis, have been tried. However, the overall prognosis for patients with FHF is quite poor, with survival rates usually reported between 10% and 30% without liver transplantation.","Liver disease"

IRAK-4 is a kinase that plays a crucial role downstream of individual TLR and IL-1R receptors and upstream of TNF receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF-6). Patients with IRAK-4 deficiency thus fail to produce TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IFN-gamma in response to IL-1beta and IL-18, respectively. Their blood cells also fail to produce IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, and TNF-alpha upon stimulation with known TLR agonists. Despite the broad impairment at the two subsequent levels of onset (TLR) and propagation (IL-1R) of inflammation, the clinical phenotype of IRAK-4 deficiency is relatively mild.

RPCA can be classified into congenital and acquired. Congenital PRCA is also known as Diamond-Blackfan anemia [DS:H00237] and is a disease of infancy and early childhood. The aetiology of acquired PRCA can be subclassified into primary and secondary. Primary PRCA is defined when no aetiology can be identified using available investigations. The causes of secondary PRCA are again diverse and can be due to infections (viral, bacterial, etc.), drugs (erythropoietin, carbamazepine, etc.), collagen vascular disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, etc.), malignancies (e.g. thymoma), ABO-incompatible haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and pregnancy. Depending on the cause, the course can be acute and self-limiting or chronic with rare spontaneous remissions. PRCA can be easily diagnosed when isolated anaemia, in the presence of normal white cell and platelet counts, is associated with a marrow of normal cellularity in which there is an almost complete absence of erythroblasts but normal myeloid cells and megakaryocytes. Primary, or secondary PRCA not responding to treatment of the underlying diseases, is treated as an immunologically-mediated disease.

"H00008","Burkitt lymphoma","Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a highly aggressive mature B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma consisting of endemic, sporadic, and immunodeficiency-associated variants. Endemic BL (eBL) affects children and young adults in Africa and some other geographical areas and carries Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in more than 95% of cases. In contrast, sporadic BL (sBL) among adolescents in Europe and North America are mostly EBV-negative. A third type of BL is associated with HIV-infection in adults. All of these subtypes possess chromosomal rearrangements of the c-myc oncogene, the genetic hallmark of BL that contributes to lymphomagenesis through alterations in cell cycle regulation, cellular differentiation, apoptosis, cellular adhesion, and metabolism. Many BL carry point mutation in the p53 tumor suppressor gene or other defects in the p14ARF-MDM2-p53 pathway, and inactivation of the p16INK4a gene by promoter methylation or homozygous deletion. This indicates that disruption of both the pRb and p53 tumor suppressor pathways is critical for BL development.","Cancer"

Clinically, DPB is characterized by chronic inflammation of the respiratory bronchioles and sinobronchial infection. While DPB is frequently compared with cystic fibrosis, a common genetic disease encountered in Caucasians, neither pancreatic insufficiency nor any obvious abnormalities of the sweat electrolytes are seen in DPB, and the two are considered to be entirely different diseases. Immunogenetic studies revealed a strong association with human HLA-B54 in Japanese, whereas an association with HLA-A11 was reported in Koreans. These findings imply that a major susceptibility gene may be located between the HLA-A and HLA-B loci on the short arm of human chromosome 6. Recently, novel mucin-like genes has been cloned in this candidate region. And it was found that their polymorphisms were associated with DPB. Over the past two decades, DPB has shifted from being a near-fatal to a treatable disease. A significant improvement in the prognosis of this disease has been attributed to the long-term use of macrolides.

The influx of Na+ exceeds the loss of K+ causing water influx and resulting in swollen erythrocytes, hemolysis, and stomatocyte formation. The OHST phenotype is also associated with a dramatic decrease or the absence of the 32-kDa membrane raft protein stomatin. OHST diagnosis is based on a hemolytic anemia associated with a massive right shift of the osmotic gradient ektacytometry curve and a decreased osmotic resistance, together with a major increase in a monovalent cation leak.

COPD is characterized by airway inflammation and progressive airflow obstruction, most commonly caused by cigarette smoking. The major symptoms of which patients complain are cough, breathlessness, and sputum production. COPD is associated with underlying inflammation in response to chronic exposure to noxious particulates and gases and with a number of comorbid conditions. The onset of COPD generally occurs in the 6th to 8th decades of life. Early onset COPD is defined as disease onset before the age of 50 years, irrespective of smoking history. The presence of persons with early onset, severely reduced pulmonary function suggests that individuals may vary in their genetic susceptibility to the effects of smoking. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is the only proven genetic risk factor for COPD. Bronchodilators are the mainstay of treatment since they improve lung function and reduce acute exacerbations. Long-acting inhaled bronchodilators are recommended as first line treatment for patients with persistent symptoms.","Lung disease"

Several case reports and studies on small series describing the clinical and histopathological features of GAMOS have revealed the clinical heterogeneity of this condition. The consistent morphological hallmark is microcephaly, which is often present at birth (primary microcephaly) but might also develop postnatally (secondary microcephaly). Major brain abnormalities include cerebral atrophy and neural-migration defects, such as agyria, microgyria, or polymicrogyria. These structural brain abnormalities are associated with severe psychomotor impairment, hypotonia, and seizures in half of all cases. The nephrotic syndrome occurs in the first four months of life with an average of three months, and a congenital nephrotic syndrome has rarely been described. This nephrotic syndrome is steroid-resistant and associated with a constant and rapid deterioration of renal function. Death usually occurs within few years from the onset.

"H01510","Malignant paraganglioma","Paragangliomas (PGLs) are rare neuroendocrine tumors that arise in sympathetic and parasympathetic paraganglia and derive from neural crest cells. Malignancy is defined by presence of metastases, tumor spread in sites where chromaffin tissue is normally absent such as lymph nodes, liver, lungs, and bones. Malignant PGLs are extremely rare. The pathogenesis and progression of PGLs are very strongly influenced by genetics. A germline mutation in one of the susceptibility genes identified so far explains ~40% of all cases; the remaining 60% are thought to be sporadic cases. Sporadic as well as hereditary PGLs have been divided in two main clusters linked to two different signalling pathways: the first cluster contains all VHL-, SDHx-, and FH- mutated tumors and is associated to the activation of hypoxic pathway, while the second cluster contains all RET- , NF1-, MAX and TMEM127- mutated tumors and is associated to the activation of MAPK and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling pathways.","Cancer"

"H00294","Dilated cardiomyopathy","Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a heart muscle disease characterised by dilation and impaired contraction of the left or both ventricles that results in progressive heart failure and sudden cardiac death from ventricular arrhythmia. Genetically inherited forms of DCM ('familial' DCM) have been identified in 25-35% of patients presenting with this disease, and the inherited gene defects are an important cause of 'familial' DCM. The pathophysiology may be separated into two categories: defects in force generation and defects in force transmission. In cases where an underlying pathology cannot be identified, the patient is diagnosed with an 'idiopathic' DCM. Current hypotheses regarding causes of 'idiopathic' DCM focus on myocarditis induced by enterovirus and subsequent autoimmune myocardium impairments. Antibodies to the beta1-adrenergic receptor (beta1AR), which are detected in a substantial number of patients with 'idiopathic' DCM, may increase the concentration of intracellular cAMP and intracellular Ca2+, a condition often leading to a transient hyper-performance of the heart followed by depressed heart function and heart failure.","Cardiovascular disease"

Selective weakness of the anterior tibial muscles is followed by weakness of the finger extensors and of selected proximal muscle groups, such as the abductors and rotators. This disease is caused by mutations in MYH7, the gene encoding the myosin heavy chain, which is expressed in type 1 fibers of skeletal muscle and in the heart.","Nervous system disease; Musculoskeletal disease"
"H00099","Leukocyte adhesion deficiency","Leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) is a rare, autosomal recessive genetic disorder in which neutrophils fail to mobilize and migrate to sites of injury. At least three genetically distinct forms of this group of disorders have been described: LAD I, II, and III. Defects in the expression of beta2-integrins and fucose- containing proteins account for LAD-I and LAD-II, respectively. In LAD-III integrin expression by leukocytes is normal, but the integrins fail to generate high avidity for their cognate endothelial-cell ligands. Mutations in the KINDLIN3 (official symbol FERMT3), a gene that encodes an intracellular protein that interacts with cytoplasmic tails of beta-integrins in hematopoietic cells, is the cause of LAD-III. Dominant-negative mutations resulting in deficiency of ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate (Rac2), the predominant hematopoeitic-specific Rho GTPase in neutrophils also leads to leukocyte adhesion deficiency.","Primary immunodeficiency"

"H00293","Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy","Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited heart muscle disease that may result in arrhythmia, heart failure, and sudden death. The hallmark pathological findings are progressive myocyte loss and fibrofatty replacement, with a predilection for the right ventricle. A number of genetic studies have identified mutations in various components of the cardiac desmosome that have important roles in the pathogenesis of ARVC. Disruption of desmosomal function by defective proteins might lead to death of myocytes under mechanical stress. The myocardial injury may be accompanied by inflammation. Since regeneration of cardiac myocytes is limited, repair by fibrofatty replacement occurs. Several studies have implicated that desmosome dysfunction results in the delocalization and nuclear translocation of plakoglobin. As a result, competition between plakoglobin and beta-catenin will lead to the inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, resulting in a shift from a myocyte fate towards an adipocyte fate of cells. The ryanodine receptor plays a crucial part in electromechanical coupling by control of release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. Therefore, defects in this receptor could result in an imbalance of calcium homeostasis that might trigger cell death.","Cardiovascular disease"

Although the precise pathophysiologic mechanism underlying NMS remains unknown, a reduction in dopaminergic activity in the brain probably by dopamine D2 receptor blockade in the striatum and hypothalamus is generally assumed as a potential cause. Laboratory findings include elevation of serum creatine phosphokinase (CK), liver enzymes, and leukocitosis. Treatment includes immediately stopping the offending agent and implementing supportive measures, as well as pharmacological interventions in more severe cases.","Nervous system disease"
"H01970","Lymphoproliferative syndrome 1","Lymphoproliferative syndrome 1 is a severe autosomal recessive lymphoproliferative disease, associated with Epstein-Barr virus. ITK mutations were identified as the cause for this disease. Common immunological features are a progressive hypogammaglobulinemia and a progressive loss of CD4+ T cells with a declining proportion of naive T cells.","Primary immunodeficiency"
"H00856","Distal hereditary motor neuropathies","Distal hereditary motor neuropathies (dHMN) comprise a heterogenous group of diseases that share the common feature of a length-dependent predominantly motor neuropathy. Many forms of dHMN have minor sensory abnormalities and/or a significant upper-motor-neuron component, and there is often an overlap with the axonal forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) [DS:H00264] and with juvenile forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [DS:H00058] and hereditary spastic paraplegia [DS:H00266]. The causative genes with autosomal dominant, recessive, and X-linked patterns of inheritance have implicated proteins with diverse functions. Distal HMN are classified into phenotypic subtypes according to age at onset, mode of inheritance, and presence of additional features.","Nervous system disease"
"H01984","Leopard syndrome","LEOPARD syndrome is an autosomal dominant developmental disorder belonging to a relatively prevalent class of inherited RAS-MAPK signalling diseases. Its main features are lentigines, electrocardiographic abnormalities, ocular hypertelorism, pulmonary valve stenosis, abnormal genitalia, retardation of growth and deafness. Approximately 90% of LEOPARD syndrome cases are caused by missense mutations in the PTPN11 gene which encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2. But it may also be caused by mutations in RAF1 or BRAF.","Congenital malformation"
"H00258","Aldosterone synthase deficiency","Aldosterone synthase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a defect in the final biochemical step of aldosterone biosynthesis, the 18-hydroxylation of 18-hydroxycorticosterone to aldosterone. This disease is characterized by life-threatening salt-loss, failure to thrive, hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia in early infancy. In type I deficiency, aldosterone is undetectable, whereas in type II aldosterone can be low or normal.","Endocrine disease"
"H02359","Dejerine-Sottas disease","Dejerine-Sottas disease (DSD), also known as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 3, is a severe, demyelinating neuropathy, presenting in infancy with delayed motor development, very slow nerve conduction velocities and elevated CSF protein. Progression is severe and walking ability is lost early. Hypomyelination and classic onion bulbs are the pathological hallmarks.

"H00118","Congenital disorders of glycosylation type I","Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a group of disorders caused by defects in various genes for N-glycan biosynthesis. CDG type I is defined by mutations in genes encoding enzymes which involves disrupted synthesis of the lipid linked oligosaccharide precursor and its transfer to polypeptide chain of protein, affecting N-glycan assembly in cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum. An increasing number of disorders have been discovered, with many subtypes identified. PMM2-CDG is the most common form, with over 800 patients diagnosed mostly in Europe. Almost all type present in infancy. These diseases demonstrate a broad range of clinical manifestation, associated with developmental delay, psychomotor retardation, hypotonia, seizures, hepatomegaly, microcephaly, and pericardial effusion.","Inherited metabolic disease"

Mutations in human NHEJ1 can lead to lymphocytopenia due to its role in V(D)J recombination in the immune system. This disease shows features common with the ones observed in LIG4 deficiency or Nijmegen breakage syndrome.","Primary immunodeficiency"
"H01802","Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum","Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PAIVS) is a severe cardiac malformation characterized by variable right ventricular development and imperforate pulmonary valve. PAIVS has a wide spectrum of clinical presentation ranging from cyanosis to shock due to closure of ductus arteriosus. The treatment follows initial stabilization with prostaglandin and establishment of antegrade flow. Because of the morphologic heterogeneity, repair or palliation strategies vary widely, ranging from single ventricle palliation to complete biventricular repair. Overall, regardless of anatomical subtype, survival is poor, reported to be as low as 50% at 5 years.","Developmental disorder; Cardiovascular disease"
"H02489","Mild encephalopathy with reversible myelin vacuolization","Mild encephalopathy with reversible myelin vacuolization (MMERV) is a familial disorder with clinical finding of mild encephalitis/encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion (MERS).

"H00127","Metachromatic leukodystrophy","Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is an autosomal recessive demyelinating lysosomal storage disease caused by deficiency of lysosomal arylsulfatase A (ARSA). The enzyme defect results in the accumulation of sulfatide in the central and peripheral nervous systems and extensive white matter damage and loss of both cognitive and motor functions. Mutated PSAP gene resulting in sphingolipid activator protein B deficiency is known to cause MLD variant in which ARSA is normal.","Inherited metabolic disease; Lysosomal storage disease; Nervous system disease"
"H01491","Neuromyelitis optica","Neuromyelitis optica (NMO), also known as Devic's disease is an inflammatory demyelinating disease that selectively affects optic nerves and spinal cord. The etiology of NMO is unknown but it is believed to be an autoimmune disorder triggered by an environmental factor, possibly an infection, in genetically susceptible individuals. The principal effector in NMO is the self-reactive, complement-activating anti-AQP4 antibody. AQP4 water channel is a component of the dystroglycan protein complex located in astrocytic foot processes at the blood-brain barrier. Anti-AQP4 antibody is sensitive and highly specific serum markers of autoimmune NMO. For many decades, NMO was considered to be a subtype of multiple sclerosis (MS), but prognosis and optimal treatments differ. Corticosteroids and plasma exchange (PLEX) are the most commonly used therapeutic modalities in acute settings. Corticosteroids exert global immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects, whereas PLEX removes antibodies, complement, and cytokines from the blood. Besides, immunosuppressant agents interfering with the function of T and B cells have been shown to prevent disease relapses and reduce neurological disability in NMO.","Immune system disease; Nervous system disease"

"H02026","Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia","Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (HHC), an autosomal dominant disorder, is characterized by lifelong elevations of serum calcium concentrations with low urinary calcium excretion. HHC is a genetically heterogeneous disorder with three variants. HHC1 is due to loss-of-function mutations of the calcium-sensing receptor. HHC2 is due to mutations in GNA11. HHC3 is associated with AP2S1 mutations, which result in altered calcium-sensing receptor endocytosis.","Congenital disorder of metabolism"
"H00771","Inherited erythromelalgia","Inherited erythromelalgia (IEM) is characterized by intense episodic burning pain associated with redness and warmth of the affected extremities and in many instances occurs as an autosomal dominant trait. Symptoms of IEM can start as early as 1 year old (early-onset), or in adults (adult-onset), and both types have been described in families and in sporadic cases. Pharmacotherapy has been largely ineffective, and partial relief of symptoms comes from cooling the affected extremities. Dominantly inherited gain-of-function mutations in SCN9A, the gene encoding Nav1.7, cause IEM.","Vascular disease"
"H01465","Large-vessel vasculitis","Large vessel vasculitis (LVV) covers a spectrum of primary vasculitides predominantly affecting the aorta and its major branches. Giant cell arteritis (GCA) and Takayasu arteritis (TAK) are the two main subtypes. GCA is the most common vasculitis affecting adults aged 50 years or more, while TAK is a rare vasculitis that affects younger individuals mainly under 40 years. Clinical presentations vary from asymptomatic to significant systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and symptoms that result from aortitis and high inflammatory markers; C-reactive protein (CRP); and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) levels. Glucocorticoids are the mainstay of therapy of LVV. Patients may develop predictable adverse effects from long-term glucocorticoid use.","Nervous system disease; Cardiovascular disease"
"H01657","Nephrotic syndrome","Nephrotic syndrome is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by heavy proteinuria (more than 3.5 grams per day), hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, and edema. Congenital nephrotic syndrome is most frequently related to mutations in genes specific for structural integrity of the glomerular basement membrane and associated filtration structures within the kidney, resulting in massive leakage of plasma proteins into the urine. First line treatment is with oral corticosteroids, but some patients do not respond to this treatment. Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) typically manifests histologically as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Calcineurin inhibitors with/without intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy (MPT) constitute the standard treatment for SRNS. It has been reported that additional rituximab treatment combined with conventional MPT and immunosuppressive agents is a promising option.","Urinary system disease"
"H00785","Congenital hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy","Hypotrichosis with juvenile macular dystrophy is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by sparse scalp hair from birth and resulting hair loss associated with progressive macular degeneration leading to blindness not later than the third decade of life.

"H01039","Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome","Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is typically an iatrogenic complication of ovulation induction (OI) occurring during the luteal phase or early pregnancy. OHSS is characterised by a cystic enlargement of the ovaries and an acute fluid shift from the intravascular to the third space, which may result in ascites, pleural infusions, pericardial infusion, and even generalized edema. Majority of OHSS cases have been associated with the use of gonadotrophins for OI in anovulatory women or for ovarian stimulation (OS) in the context of assisted reproductive technology (ART). Recurrent cases and familial occurrence of OHSS have been described, and different mutations in the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHr) have been reported in these cases. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) appears to be the major predisposing factor for OHSS in a large number of studies.","Reproductive system disease"
"H01805","Tricho-hepato-enteric syndrome","Tricho-hepato-enteric syndrome (THE), also known as syndromic diarrhea (SD), is a congenital enteropathy presenting with early-onset severe intractable diarrhea and associated with non-specific villous atrophy with low or no mononuclear cell infiltration of the lamina propria nor specific histological abnormalities involving the epithelium. Infants are born small for gestational age. Patients present with facial dysmorphism, immune disorders and, in some patients, early onset of severe liver cirrhosis. It has been linked to abnormalities in two components of the putative human ski complex: SKIV2L and TTC37. During their clinical course, most of the patients require parenteral nutrition and often immunoglobulin supplementation.","Congenital malformation"
"H00923","Congenital systemic glutamine deficiency","Congenital systemic glutamine deficiency (CSGD) is a rare developmental disorder with severe brain malformation resulting in multi-organ failure and neonatal death. Glutamine synthetase plays a major role in ammonia detoxification, interorgan nitrogen flux, acid-base homeostasis, and cell signaling.

"H00749","Episodic ataxias","Episodic ataxias (EAs) are a group of rare autosomal-dominant diseases characterized by recurrent, discrete episodes of ataxia, giddiness, and vertigo. EA1 and EA2 are the most widely recognized of the autosomal-dominant EAs and are caused by dysfunction of neuronal voltage-gated ion channels. There are central and peripheral nervous system manifestations in both conditions. The current classification is based on genetics and actually includes seven distinct subtypes. But these variants other than EA1 and EA2 are rare, some only occurring in single families, and gene mutations have not been identified in all. It is quite likely, however, that the number of phenotypes and mutated genes will grow further.","Nervous system disease"
"H01006","Hereditary angioedema","Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disorder, manifested by recurrent episodes of angioedema localized to the skin or mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract or larynx. The laryngeal angioedema is potentially lethal. The classic forms, HAE types I and II, result from deficiency of the plasma protease inhibitor, C1 inhibitor (C1INH). Type I HAE is caused by decreased expression of C1INH in the plasma whereas type 2 HAE, consisting approximately 15% of patients with HAE, is due to expression of a dysfunctional C1INH protein. HAE type III has been observed exclusively in women and appears to be correlated with high estrogen levels.","Vascular disease"
"H01234","Trimethylaminuria","Trimethylaminuria (TMAU), also known as fish odour syndrome, is a metabolic disorder. TMAU usually presents with a body odour resembling that of rotten or decaying fish, the result of excess excretion of trimethylamine (TMA) in the breath, sweat, urine, and reproductive fluids. Primary TMAU is most often caused by a functional defect of flavin mono-oxygenase 3 (FMO3), and the genetic disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner as a consequence of mutations in the FMO3 gene. Secondary TMAU has been described in patients with severe liver disease (which is the major site of activity of the FMO3 enzyme) and chronic renal disease (as a consequence of bacterial overgrowth in the gut), and in patients treated with large doses of betaine or possibly L-carnitine. In addition, transient TMAU has been reported in a preterm infant who was fed with choline-rich food supplements and has been reported in some women just at the onset of menstruation.","Inherited metabolic disease"
"H01650","Pemphigoid","Pemphigoid diseases are group of autoimmune blistering disorders of the skin and mucous membranes characterized by autoantibodies directed against structural proteins of the dermal-epidermal junction that clinically can manifest with urticarial lesions, tense blisters, and erosions which may involve the mucous membranes. Diseases in this group include bullous pemphigoid (BP), dermatitis herpetiformis, mucous membrane pemphigois, linear IgA bullous dermatosis, herpes gestationis, and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. BP is the most common acquired bullous autoimmune dermatosis disease. It is primarily a disease of the elderly with an equal incidence in men and women. The clinical characteristics are the formation of tense blisters and pruritic urticarial erythema. Histopathologically, subepidermal blister formation associated with eosinophil infiltration is commonly observed in BP. The main autoantigens targeted by BP autoantibodies are hemidesmosomal transmembrane collagen XVII (COL17, also known as BP180/BPAG2) and the intracytoplasmic plakin family protein BP230. Most of these antibodies belong to the immunoglobulin G class. Diagnosis of BP relies on the clinical and histological aspects, but the most reliable clues are given by direct and indirect immunofluorescence. Three types of drugs, with distinct mechanisms of action, are used to treat BP: anti-inflammatory drugs, drugs designed to reduce the production of pathogenic antibodies, and treatments that increase the elimination of pathogenic antibodies from the serum of patients, such as high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy and therapeutic plasma exchange.","Skin and connective tissue disease; Immune system disease"
"H00782","Hypotrichosis and recurrent skin vesicles","Hypotrichosis and recurrent skin vesicles is a condition with sparse and fragile hair on scalp and vesicles on the skin over the body. Desmocollin 3, a transmembrane component of desmosomes, is associated with the disease.","Skin disease"

More than 50 species of RGM have been identified, more than a third of which are opportunistic human pathogens. The most frequently encountered RGM that cause human infections are Mycobacterium abscessus, Mycobacterium chelonae, Mycobacterium fortuitum (complex), Mycobacterium mucogenicum, and Mycobacterium neoaurum. RGM, generally of low virulence, are capable of causing a wide spectrum of infections. Many RGM species, well-known and recently described species, caused significant infections in patients with cancer, including catheter-related bacteremia, disseminated infection, bronchopulmonary infections, dermatitis, cellulitis, and others.","Infectious disease"

Nystagmus that occur independent of these known ocular or systemic diseases is referred to as congenital motor nystagmus (CMN) or idiopathic congenital nystagmus (ICN). It can be inherited as an autosomal dominant, an autosomal recessive, or an X-linked trait. At least six genetic loci for CMN have been suggested, including three loci for autosomal dominant CMN, and three loci for X-linked CMN. A variety of mutations in the FRMD7 gene have been identified in many families with an X-linked recessive pattern. Another mutation associated with X-linked CMN is GPR143.","Nervous system disease"

It has been suggested that abnormal expansions of TTTCA and TTTTA repeats in introns of SAMD12, TNRC6A and RAPGEF2 cause this disease. Recently, Autosomal recessive form with a mutation in CNTN2 gene has been reported.","Nervous system disease"
"H00120","Muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy type A","Muscular dystrophies due to reduced glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan have emerged as a common group of conditions, now referred to as dystroglycanopathies. The phenotypic severity of dystroglycanopathy patients is extremely variable. At the most severe end of the clinical spectrum are Walker-Warburg syndrome (WWS), Muscle-eye-brain disease (MEB), and Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD). These are termed muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy type A (MDDGA), and characterized by congenital muscular dystrophy with severe structural brain and eye abnormalities, which in WWS results in early infantile death.","Congenital disorder of metabolism; Congenital malformation"

"H01833","Hemimegalencephaly","Hemimegalencephaly is a rare brain malformation caused by anomalous neuronal and glial proliferation or differentiation, with an abnormally enlarged and dysplastic hemisphere. It can occur as an isolated finding, or as part of a syndrome, such as hypomelanosis of Ito, tuberous sclerosis complex, epidermal nevus syndrome or Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome. Patients have intellectual delay, hemiparesis and severe epilepsy. Drug resistant epilepsy is often treated with a hemispherectomy. If resective surgery is impossible, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can be used for seizure palliation. The etiology of hemimegalencephaly is not clear. Some authors consider abnormal neuroepithelial cell lineage as the primary cause.","Congenital malformation"
"H01659","Pityriasis rubra pilaris","Pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) is a spectrum of rare chronic inflammatory disorders with papulosquamous eruptions of unknown cause. The prototypical clinical characteristics of PRP are follicular hyperkeratotic papules on an erythematous base that can eventually coalesce to large red plaques. Its classification into five subgroups is based on age at onset, clinical course, morphologic features, and prognosis. More than 50% of patients are best classified as type I with adult-onset PRP. It is comprised of widespread, follicular papules and plaques and tends to clear spontaneously in 80% of patients in one to three years. Type II, which is the atypical adult subtype, tends to be more chronic and presents with areas of alopecia, eczematous patches, and a palmoplantar keratoderma. The classic juvenile type III is observed in only 10% of patients. It is similar clinically to type I but occurs in children and tends to remit in one year. Type IV, which is the circumscribed, juvenile subtype, presents with sharply-demarcated areas of follicular hyperkeratosis and erythema of the elbows and knees. An estimated 5% of children with PRP develop an atypical form classified as juvenile type V. Most familial cases that are published belong to this group. Recently, the designation of a new category of PRP (type VI) has been proposed that is characterized by the presence of HIV infection with different clinical features and a poorer prognosis. Treatment of PRP can be difficult, and no standardized approach has been established, although systemic retinoids are considered first-line therapy. Cyclosporin, methotrexate, and azathioprine are alternatives.","Skin and connective tissue disease"

"H00129","Mucopolysaccharidosis type II","Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS2) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficient activity of iduronate-2-sulfatase in glycosaminoglycan degradation. The enzyme defect results in the accumulation of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate in many organs, as well as elevated metabolite levels in urine. The heterogeneity of clinical phenotypes, ranging from mild-to-severe forms, is a result of different mutations in the IDS gene. This disorder is characterized by mental retardation, coarse faces, short stature, hearing loss, hydrocephalus, hepatosplenomegaly, dysostosis multiplex, airway obstruction, and cardiac valve disease.","Inherited metabolic disease; Lysosomal storage disease"
"H00915","Tuberous sclerosis complex","Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), also known as Bourneville-Pringle disease, is a rare, slowly progressive genetic disorder characterized by pervasive benign tumors in most organ systems including the brain, skin, kidney, liver, lung, and heart, which is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Patients with TSC are frequently diagnosed with comorbid neurological disorders, including epilepsy, intellectual disability, behavioral dysregulation, sleep disorders, and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). TSC most often results from spontaneous genetic mutations in one or two genes, TSC1 and TSC2, which encode hamartin and tuberin, respectively. These gene products form a physical and functional complex to limit activation of the mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1. When these genes are deficient, mTOR complex 1 is constitutively up-regulated, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and protein synthesis.","Congenital malformation"
"H01666","Angiosarcoma","Angiosarcomas are rare, generally aggressive, malignant mesenchymal tumours of vascular origin and constitute less than 1% of all sarcomas. Their most frequent site of origin is the head and neck, especially the scalp, of elderly men. Angiosarcomas are likely derived from vascular endothelial cells, possibly resulting from aberrant angiogenesis. Studies have shown relatively increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors (VEGFr1-3) in human angiosarcoma. The most common gene mutation in angiosarcomas is KRAS as well as other RAS mutations. Activation of the RAS pathway is often tumorigenic. Although immortalised murine endothelial cells form benign haemangiomas in vivo, the addition of activated HRAS produces rapidly growing, poorly differentiated angiosarcomas.","Cancer"
"H00586","Epidermolysis bullosa, junctional","Inherited epidermolysis bullosa is a diverse group of disorders characterized by mechanically fragile skin that readily blister.

"H01202","Cataract","Cataracts can be defined as any opacity of the crystalline lens, often associated with breakdown of the lens microarchitecture, possibly including vacuole formation and disarray of lens cells, which can cause large fluctuations in density resulting in light scattering. In addition, light scattering and opacity will occur if there is a significant amount of high molecular weight protein aggregates. Cataracts can be classified by the age at onset: a congenital or infantile cataract presents within the first year of life; a juvenile cataract presents within the first decade of life; a presenile cataract presents before the age of about 45 years, and senile or age-related cataract after that. Congenital cataracts are a major cause of induced blindness in children, and inherited cataracts are the major cause of congenital cataracts. Inherited congenital cataracts have been associated with mutations in specific genes, including those of crystallins, gap junction proteins, membrane transport and channel proteins, the cytoskeleton, and growth and transcription factors. Inherited congenital cataracts may be inherited as autosomal dominant (most frequent), autosomal recessive, or X-linked traits.","Nervous system disease"

"H01692","Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma","Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) is the most common central nervous system tumor in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Although these lesions are generally benign and non-infiltrative, they commonly arise in the region of the foramen of Monro, where they can cause obstructive hydrocephalus and sudden death. TSC is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by inactivating mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes. These mutations lead to constitutive upregulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which affects many cellular processes involved in tumor growth. Clinical studies have demonstrated that mTOR inhibitors can induce regression of SEGA in patients with TSC, providing a viable alternative to surgical removal.","Nervous system disease"
"H02017","Sandhoff disease","Sandhoff disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in HEXB that encodes beta-hexosaminidase subunit beta. Sandhoff disease is characterized by combined deficiency of hexosaminidase A (HexA) and hexosaminidase B (HexB) activities. GM2 ganglioside cannot be hydrolyzed and therefore accumulates primarily in neuronal tissues. This results in progressive neurologic degeneration. The severe form is characterized by an early age of onset and a rapidly progressive clinical course leading to death in early childhood, whereas the juvenile and adult forms start later and generally manifest a less severe course.","Inherited metabolic disease; Lysosomal storage disease"
"H02225","Familial cirrhosis","Familial cirrhosis is a condition that is associated with the presence of liver disease with genetic linkage among multiple family members in a generation or in multiple generations. The well-documented causes of familial cirrhosis are mutations of keratin 8 and 18 gene.

"H00747","Thyrotoxic hypokalemic periodic paralysis","Thyrotoxic hypokalemic periodic paralysis (TPP) is characterized by thyrotoxicosis in combination with typical episodes of hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP). People of Asian descent are most often affected, but all ethnicities can present with TPP. Hypokalemia is typical during paralysis, but is not always detected; administration of potassium during the attacks should be offered cautiously, preferably orally, to prevent rebound hyperkalemia. Mutations have been identified in TPP patients in an inwardly rectifying potassium channel, , that is expressed in muscle and transcriptionally regulated by thyroid hormone. Mutations in Kir2.6, which occur in up to 33% of patients, reinforces the hypothesis of genetic heterogeneity in patients with TPP.","Nervous system disease; Musculoskeletal disease; Congenital disorder of metabolism"
"H01695","Erythema multiforme","Erythema multiforme (EM) is an immune-mediated, mucocutaneous condition characterized by 'target' lesions. Classically, EM has been separated into 2 subgroups, EM minor and EM major. In EM minor, lesions often present as papules, which might enlarge and eventually form the typical target lesion with erythema surrounding an area of central clearing. The rash in EM minor preferentially affects the limbs, specifically the extensor surfaces, however, it can also be seen throughout the body, excluding mucous membranes. EM major has mucous membrane involvement. The oral mucosa is most commonly affected, initially with edema that progresses to superficial erosions. Other surfaces that might be involved include the anogenital, ocular, and nasal mucosa. Although previously thought to be on a similar continuum of EM, and histologically appearing the same, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is increasingly being considered a separate disease process. It is currently believed that EM is a result of an immune reaction to an inciting infectious or pharmacologic antigen. The most common infectious organisms in EM are herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, as well as Mycoplasma pneumonia. The first line of treatment for EM is removal of the inciting factor when possible. Systemic steroids have been suggested as adjuvant therapy based on their immunosuppressant effects. To date, their use has been limited to EM major, as EM minor is self-limited.","Skin and connective tissue disease"
"H02010","Galactose epimerase deficiency","Galactose epimerase deficiency is the least understood form of galactosemia. Originally, galactose epimerase deficiency was identified as a biochemical oddity that impacted only red and white blood cells in apparently healthy individuals. This condition was termed 'peripheral type' because it impacted only cells in peripheral circulation. Subsequently, rare patients were identified who were severely symptomatic and demonstrated epimerase deficiency in various cell types, and it was termed 'generalized type'.","Inherited metabolic disease"

Male patients with X-linked Alport syndrome suffer from severe renal symptoms that progress to end-stage renal disease associated with deafness which starts during the first decade of life, and ocular lesions including anterior lenticonus. Autosomal recessive Alport syndrome is usually severe, showing progressive nephritis and hearing impairment.","Congenital malformation"
"H01453","Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder","Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder (OCRD) is a group of disorders that is characterized by having preoccupations (obsessions) and/or repetitive behaviors (compulsions). Previously, Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) was grouped with the anxiety disorders. However, the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) moved OCD into a new category, because much of the evidence suggests OCD and OC-spectrum disorders are distinct from other anxiety disorders. Although OCD and anxiety disorders often share core clinical feature, significant differences also exist in effective first-line pharmacological interventions. Patients with anxiety disorders respond to a wide range of pharmacological interventions. In contrast, patients with OCD do not respond to nonserotonergic agents. OCRD includes OCD, Trichotillomania, Hoarding disorder, Excoriation disorder, and Body dysmorphic disorder.","Mental and behavioural disorder"

They evolve as clusters of foam cells and favor the neck, upper trunk, flexural folds and periorbital region. The foam cells are formed from macrophages as a consequence of gradual intracellular accumulation of lipids taken up by specific receptors or by the mechanism of phagocytosis. They are seen in several lipidoses and are usually indicative of a derangement in lipoprotein metabolism, in particular familial hypercholesterolemia. Prevention of xanthomas goes hand in hand with the management of the underlying disorders of lipid metabolism. Normolipemic xanthomatosis may be seen in several rare conditions.","Congenital disorder of metabolism"

The imprinted region 11p15 is separated into two domains, with each domain regulated by a functionally independent imprinting control regions (ICR). The centromeric ICR2 regulates the expression of CDKN1C, KCNQ1, and further genes. The majority of cases of BWS show hypomethylation in the ICR2 or mutations in the ICR2-regulated CDKN1C gene. In intron 10 of the KCNQ1 locus, the untranslated KCNQ1OT1 RNA is encoded. KCNQ10T1 is expressed by the paternal allele and probably represses realization of the CDKN1C gene. In the telomeric ICR1, hypermethylation of the H19 promoter and loss of imprinting of IGF2 have been reported in a small fraction of patients with BWS. A few BWS cases could be related to NSD1 deletions or mutations.","Congenital malformation"

Hyperlipidemia, which refers to an increase in cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), or both, is the most common form of dyslipidemia. Hyperlipidemias can be classified as familial (also called primary) caused by an inherited gene mutation, or acquired (also called secondary) when resulting from underlying disorders that lead to alterations in plasma lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. The causes of acquired hyperlipidemia include dietary, alcohol intake, oral contraceptives, diabetes mellitus, and pharmacological agents (e.g., retinoic acid derivatives, steroids, and beta-blockers). Familial hyperlipidemias are classified according to the Fredrickson classification (hyperlipoproteinemia types I to V) which is based on lipoprotein analyses by electrophoresis or ultracentrifugation. It was later adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO). Hyperlipidemias are also classified according to which types of lipids are elevated.

"H01860","Abnormal pituitary gonadotropin secretion","There are two pituitary gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Their general biological roles are the stimulation of testicular and ovarian functions via the regulation of gametogenesis and steroid hormone synthesis in the gonads. Synthesis and release of FSH is triggered by the arrival of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. LH is synthesized similarly within the pituitary gland, requiring the same stimulus as FSH, the GnRH from the hypothalamus. Both hypothalamic abnormalities and intrinsic pituitary abnormalities can cause an abnormal FSH/LH response to GnRH. Hypersecretion of gonadotropins are often associated with pituitary adenomas [DS:H01102] and central precocious puberty [DS:H00937]. Hyposecretion of gonadotropins [DS:H00255 H01700] in premenopausal women leads to absent menstrual cycles, infertility, vaginal dryness, and loss of some female characteristics. In men, this deficiency leads to impotence, atrophy of the testes, decreased sperm production, infertility, and loss of some male characteristics.","Endocrine disease"

For example, intermediary metabolites that accumulate due to enzymatic defects in other pathways, may inhibit the urea cycle. The most relevant group of disorders in this respect is that of organic acidemias. The urea cycle function may be impaired by substrate deficiencies assumed cause in various disorders including lysinuric protein intolerance, pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase deficiency, and fatty acid oxidation defects. In addition to the urea cycle, mammals require the function of glutamine synthetase to completely detoxify ammonia.","Inherited metabolic disease"

"H01436","Guillain-Barre syndrome","Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an acute polyneuropathy characterized by progressive motor weakness of limbs with areflexia. This disease is usually triggered by an infection, which provokes immune-mediated nerve dysfunction. GBS can be subdivided into the classic acute demyelinating type, acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN), and acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN). Classic acute demyelinating type is designated acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), representing the great majority of cases in Europe and North America. A mutation in the PMP22 gene was identified in a family with AIDP. AMAN is the most prevalent form in China. The incidence of AMSAN is very low. The axonal forms of GBS are caused by certain autoimmune mechanisms, due to a molecular mimicry between antecedent bacterial infection (particularly Campylobacter jejuni) and human peripheral nerve gangliosides.","Nervous system disease"
"H01604","Polymyositis and dermatomyositis","Polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM) are the two major forms of inflammatory muscle diseases. PM and DM, along with sporadic inclusion-body myositis (sIBM), belong to the heterogeneous group of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs), which are characterized by weakness and chronic inflammation of skeletal muscle. PM and DM differ in their clinical features, histopathology, response to treatment, and prognosis. Although their clinical pictures differ, they both present with symmetrical, proximal muscle weakness. PM is a term that was used traditionally to denote all IIMs that were not DM or sIBM, but it is now a controversial entity with questionable specificity. Traditionally, PM is described as presenting with weakness of the proximal muscles that evolves over weeks to months and affects adults, but rarely children. DM typically includes subacute progressive proximal muscle weakness and a skin rash. The disease mechanisms of PM and DM that cause muscle damage and dysfunction are not fully understood. However, because of the association with other autoimmune diseases, the presence of autoantibodies, and response to immunosuppressive medication, they are believed to be autoimmune in origin. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of the innate immune system and non-immune mechanisms and described novel adaptive immune-based pathways in the pathogenesis of PM and DM. Treatment of inflammatory myopathies is generally empirical. Corticosteroids still remain the agents of choice for the initial treatment, but their use is limited by the high frequency of side effects. In addition, as a substantial number of patients do not respond to glucocorticoids alone, additional agents such as immunosuppressants, immunomodulators, and more recently, biologics are commonly used in clinical practice.","Musculoskeletal disease"

"H00346","Extrinsic allergic alveolitis","Extrinsic allergic alveolitis (EAA), also known as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, is caused by repeated inhalation of mainly organic antigens by sensitized subjects. This induces a hypersensitivity response in the distal bronchioles and alveoli and subjects may present clinically with a variety of symptoms. EAA is caused by a wide variety of antigens including bacteria, organic materials, fungal spores, and chemicals. Of the various EAA syndromes, Farmer's lung and Bird fancier's disease are the commonest forms that have been studied. EEA is a complex dynamic clinical syndrome where clinical expression depends on the frequency and amount of contact with antigen and host susceptibility. The manifestations and symptoms can be complicated by self-regulatory measures performed by those affected individuals to reduce antigen exposure. There are many individuals with a positive antibody reaction who remain asymptomatic. EEA traditionally has been described as occurring in a state of acute, subacute, and chronic form.","Immune system disease; Respiratory disease; Infectious disease"

"H01851","Congenital scoliosis associated with rib anomalies","Congenital scoliosis is a lateral curvature of the spine that is due to the presence of vertebral anomalies causing an imbalance in the longitudinal growth of the spine. Most congenital scoliosis is often recognized at birth, but more subtle spinal defects can remain undetected. A close interaction of genes and environment regulates the development of normal spine. Developmental studies in animal models have identified many genes regulating somite formation and segmentation. Patients with congenital scoliosis frequently have other associated anomalies. Sometimes rib fusion or absence can be observed along with the spinal anomalies since ribs are formed in close association with the vertebrae. When the number of ribs on the right or left side do not match, congenital vertebral anomalies should be suspected. An extensive thoracic congenital scoliosis associated with fused ribs may affect thoracic function and the growth of the lungs in young children and lead to a thoracic insufficiency syndrome. The vertebral expandable prosthetic titanium rib (VEPTR) holds the expanded hemithorax. This improves the thoracic height, lung volume and lung function.","Congenital malformation"

Most infections are mild, but a small proportion of infected individuals may develop serious pneumonia due to an enhanced host cellular immune response.","Infectious disease"
"H01293","Narcolepsy","Narcolepsy is a disabling sleep disorder characterized by irresistible excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy, a condition triggered by strong emotions leading to a sudden loss of muscle tone. Narcolepsy is a rare and mainly sporadic disorder. Familial narcolepsy accounts for less than 10% of all narcolepsy cases, and causative mutations have not been identified to date. The discovery of hypocretin-1 (HCRT) deficiency shed light on the underlying pathophysiology of the disease. The hypocretin neurotransmission system was shown to play a major role in controlling vigilance states. Because of the strong HLA association, hypocretin deficiency is believed to be caused by an autoimmune attack. It has also been reported that a missense mutation in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) is the cause of narcolepsy.","Nervous system disease"

"H01603","Primary aldosteronism","Primary aldosteronism is a clinical syndrome characterized by excess secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal gland. It is manifested by hypertension and hyporeninemia. In the past, hypokalemia was thought to be a mandatory finding in primary aldosteronism. However, later studies confirmed that most patients with primary aldosteronism are normokalemic. The prevalence of primary aldosteronism among nonselected hypertensive persons is between 5% and 13%, and it is now recognized to be the most common form of secondary hypertension. There are the seven subtypes of primary aldosteronism. Aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) and bilateral idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA) are the most common subtypes of primary aldosteronism. Unilateral adrenal hyperplasia, aldosterone-producing adrenocortical carcinoma, ectopic aldosterone-producing adenoma, and familial hyperaldosteronism (type I and typeII) are unusual subtypes. Somatic mutations in KCNJ5, ATP1A1, ATP2B3, and CACNA1D have been described in APAs. Usually, adenomas are managed surgically and bilateral hyperplasia, medically.","Endocrine disease"

CYC1, UQCRB, UQCRQ, and UQCRC2 encode components of CIII itself, whereas BCS1L, TTC19, LYRM7, UQCC2, and UQCC3 produce mitochondrial assembly factors.","Congenital disorder of metabolism"
"H01431","Cushing syndrome","Cushing syndrome (CS) is a rare disorder resulting from prolonged exposure to excess glucocorticoids via exogenous and endogenous sources. The typical clinical features of CS are related to hypercortisolism and include accumulation of central fat, moon facies, neuromuscular weakness, osteoporosis or bone fractures, metabolic complications, and mood changes. Traditionally, endogenous CS is classified as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-dependent (about 80%) or ACTH- independent (about 20%). Among ACTH-dependent forms, pituitary corticotroph adenoma (Cushing's disease) is most common. Most pituitary tumors are sporadic, resulting from monoclonal expansion of a single mutated cell. Recently recurrent activating somatic driver mutations in the ubiquitin-specific protease 8 gene (USP8) were identified in almost half of corticotroph adenoma. Germline mutations in MEN1 (encoding menin), AIP (encoding aryl-hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein), PRKAR1A (encoding cAMP-dependent protein kinase type I alpha regulatory subunit) and CDKN1B (encoding cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B; also known as p27 Kip1) have been identified in familial forms of pituitary adenomas. However, the frequency of familial pituitary adenomas is less than 5% in patients with pituitary adenomas. Among ACTH-independent CS, adrenal adenoma is most common. Rare adrenal causes of CS include primary bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (BMAH) or primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD).","Endocrine and metabolic disease"
"H01869","Megacystis microcolon intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome","Megacystis microcolon intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS) is a rare congenital anomaly with decreased muscular tone in the urinary tract and intestine. MMIHS is characterized by prenatal-onset distended urinary bladder with functional intestinal obstruction. Hypoperistalsis causes a pseudo-obstruction which leads to a shortened and malrotated microcolon and food intolerance. MMIHS usually affects women, and is almost lethal in the first year of life. Although pro-kinetic agents and alimentation have prolonged life in some cases, but the long term outcome remains poor. Extensive surgical intervention is required for survival. Pathogenesis of MMIHS remains unclear but impaired peristalsis seems to be owing to abnormal ganglion cells pattern and absence of interstitial Cajal cells. While it is believed to be an autosomal recessive disorder, most cases are sporadic. It has been identified de novo ACTG2 mutations cause MMIHS.","Congenital malformation"

"H01267","Familial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia","Familial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (HHF) is the most common cause of persistent hypoglycemia in infancy. Recent studies on the molecular basis of the disease have disclosed specific genetic defects in the regulation of insulin secretion. Seven different loci have been associated with hyperinsulinism: ABCC8, KCNJ11, HADHSC, GCK, GLUD1, SLC16A1, and INSR. Mutations of these loci have significant differences in phenotype and inheritance pattern. The most common genes associated with hyperinsulinism, involve the ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes that encode the two subunits of the beta-cell ATP-dependent potassium channel. Recessive mutations of these genes cause a severe form of neonatal hypoglycemia that frequently requires near-total pancreatectomy. Diazoxide, a drug that acts as an agonist of the ATP-dependent potassium channel to suppress insulin secretion, is effective in defects associated with mutations of GLUD1 and HADHSC. Diazoxide is often ineffective in mutations of the ATP- dependent potassium channel and may not adequately control hypoglycemia in GCK or SLC16A1 mutations.","Inherited metabolic disease"

"H02481","Syndromic disorder with short stature","Short stature is one of the major components of many dysmorphic syndromes. Growth failure may be due to a wide variety of mechanisms, either related to the growth hormone (GH) or to underlying unknown pathologies. Several underlying genetic causes of these disorders have been identified.","Congenital malformation"
"H01660","Pityriasis rosea","Pityriasis rosea (PR) is an acute exanthem, which prevalently affects children and young adults. The cause of PR is uncertain but epidemiological (seasonal variation and clustering in communities) and clinical features suggest an infective agent. Light and electron microscopy findings suggest infection with human herpesviruses 6 and 7 (HHV-6/7). HHV-6 and HHV-7 may also interact with each other, explaining recurrences and atypical presentations. PR is self limiting and resolves within one to three months. It typically starts with the development of a large erythematous scaly plaque also called the herald patch or mother patch on trunk or neck, which is followed by an eruption of multiple secondary small erythematous scaly lesions located predominantly on the trunk and following the lines of cleavage on the back (Christmas tree or inverted fir tree appearance). Collarette scaling is seen typically. The eruption is usually preceded by a prodrome of sore throat, gastrointestinal disturbance, fever, and arthralgia. A case of PR is diagnosed mainly on clinical grounds. A biopsy is needed in atypical cases, and it mainly helps in excluding other differentials rather than diagnosing PR as the histopathological examination in a case of PR is relatively nonspecific and resembles a subacute or chronic dermatitis. As PR is a self-limiting disorder, most patients just need to be counseled regarding the natural course of the disease instead of putting them on an aggressive treatment protocol. Most patients would just need emollients, antihistaminics, and sometimes topical steroids to control pruritus.","Skin and connective tissue disease"

"H01694","Stevens-Johnson syndrome","Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are severe acute mucocutaneous diseases. The early stage of the disease is characterized by red-purple maculopapular eruptions. Then epidermal separation occurs and vesicles and bullae are formed. Inflammatory changes including purulent conjunctivitis, erosion, ulcer and crusts may be observed in the eye, mouth, nose, pharynx, esophagus, trachea, gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract and genital mucosae. Life-threatening bleeding and infections may be observed as a result of these changes. The rates of severe complications or sequelae secondary to SJS and TEN are higher in patients with mucosal and ophthalmic involvement. The SJS and TEN are considered the same disease process, and the distinction is made based on body surface area involvement. The SJS is characterized by less than 10% of the body surface area of epidermal detachment, and TEN by more than 30%. Various etiologic factors have been implicated as causes of SJS-TEN. These include infection, vaccination, drugs, systemic diseases, physical agents, and food. Drugs are the most commonly blamed. It has been reported that SJS-TEN is strongly associated with the specific variants of the human leukocyte antigen HLA-A and HLA-B genes. There is still no consensus on a definite treatment method for SJS-TEN. Systemic steroids and IVIG are used most frequently in medical treatment and treatment options including cyclosporine, plasmapheresis and hemodialysis are required more rarely.","Skin and connective tissue disease"

"H01658","Microscopic polyangiitis","Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) is an idiopathic autoimmune disease characterized by systemic vasculitis. MPA predominantly affects small-calibre blood vessels and is associated with the presence of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA). The association with ANCAs originally defined the group of ANCA-associated vasculitides, comprising granulomatosis with polyangitis (GPA, formerly known as Wegener granulomatosis) [DS:H01655], microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA, formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome) [DS:H01468], which have different frequencies of ANCA-positivity. ANCA in MPA are predominantly directed against myeloperoxidase (MPO-ANCA) but may, in a minority of patients, be directed against proteinase 3 (PR3-ANCA). Not all patients, however, have ANCA. MPA is clinically characterized by small-vessel vasculitis primarily affecting the kidneys and the lungs but other organs may be involved as well. Renal involvement, which can be the only manifestation, is clinically apparent as rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and histopathologically as pauci-immune necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis. Diagnosis is mainly established by clinical manifestations, computed tomography (TC), ANCA antibody detection, and renal and pulmonary biopsy. The introduction of aggressive immunosuppressive treatment has substantially improved the prognosis. The standardized therapeutic regimen is based on cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids. Using this regimen, remission can be achieved in most of the patients. Rituximab may represent an important alternative to cyclophosphamide for patients who may not respond adequately to antimetabolite therapies.","Nervous system disease; Cardiovascular disease; Immune system disease"

The disease is present almost equally in both sexes. The etiology of EF remains uncertain. Hematological, infectious, and autoimmune diseases, as well as intense physical exertion, chemical compounds, drugs, solid neoplasms, and physical factors have been proposed as possible triggers and associated factors. Some researchers have proposed an aberrant immune response as the main pathogenetic mechanism. Some EF patients improve spontaneously without treatment, but in those who do not, glucocorticoids are the mainstay therapy.

"H01803","Pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect","Pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect (PA-VSD) is a rare and complex cyanotic congenital heart malformation that has a high incidence of early mortality. PA-VSD presents with complete absence of any communication between the right ventricle and the pulmonary arteries. The blood supply to the pulmonary arteries is provided by a patent arterial duct or by major aorto pulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs). Two-thirds of the cases with pulmonary atresia are associated with MAPCAs, which can vary greatly in number and site of origin. PA-VSD shares similarities with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and has been considered a severe end of the spectrum of TOF. Although surgical interventions have been employed successfully for a number of years, the long-term prognosis has remained poor with an increased incidence of sudden death. An association between conotruncal cardiac abnormalities and 22q11.2 deletion during fetal life has been investigated and reported to occur in 20% of cases of PA-VSD.","Developmental disorder; Cardiovascular disease"
"H00589","Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy","Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) is inherited retinal disorders with ocular manifestations that are caused by alterations in the Wnt signaling network. FEVR has an abnormal vascularization of the peripheral retina with the formation of retinal folds, retinal detachment, and in many cases the creation of a fibrovascular membrane located behind the lens. Mutations in NDP, FZD4, and LRP5 have been reported to be responsible for ophthalmic diseases including Norrie disease, FEVR, and osteoporosis pseudoglioma syndrome. The proteins encoded by these genes have all been shown to participate in the Wnt/Norrin signaling pathway. Recently, heterozygous mutations in TSPAN12, which is a component of the Norrin-FZD4-LRP5 signaling complex, have been found to be responsible for autosomal dominant FEVR.","Nervous system disease"
"H01669","Secondary hyperparathyroidism","Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is a chronic and progressive disorder characterized by elevated serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), parathyroid gland hyperplasia, and disturbances in mineral metabolism, mainly calcium and phosphorus. SHPT is generally caused by diffuse parathyroid hyperplasia in response to prolonged reduced levels of extracellular calcium from various secondary aetiologies. Although it is initially and adaptive response to a variety of stimuli resulting mainly in extracellular hypocalcaemia (vitamin D deficiency, chronic kidney disease, idiopathic hypercalciuria, calcium malabsorption), long-standing SHPT may eventually develop into autonomous HPT (ie, tertiary HPT). Because SHPT is a compensatory mechanism of the parathyroid glands, it commonly resolves with normalization of calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. After excluding reversible secondary aetiologies, first-line treatment of irreversible SHPT (often related to chronic kidney disease) mainly involves medical therapies.","Endocrine disease"

CDG-II is defined by mutations in genes encoding enzymes in the processing of N-glycans on the glycosylated proteins either late in the endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi compartments. Multiple subtypes have been identified although the numbers and forms of affected individuals with CDG-I are still much more. In contrast to type I, the type II patients show a more severe psychomotor retardation, no peripheral neuropathy and a cerebellar hypoplasia. According to the serum transferrin glycoform, a portion of CDG-II can be diagnosed. Distinct from CDG-I, the serum trisialo- and asialotransferrin are increased in CDG-II.","Inherited metabolic disease"
"H01656","Psoriasis","Psoriasis (PSORS) is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease, characterized by increased propagation of the epidermis with dilation of dermal capillaries. The major symptoms of psoriasis are itchy, scaly, and flaky skin, swelling, pain, and disfiguring skin lesions. Plaque psoriasis is the most common form. Other forms include flexural, guttate, nail, inverse psoriasis, erythroderma, and psoriatic arthritis. Nail psoriasis can accompany any form of psoriasis or occur of its own accord. It can occur in any age group, but psoriatic arthritis usually develops between the ages of 30-50 years. Various factors such as bacterial infection, genetic and environmental factors, and immune disorders play an important role in causing psoriasis. Psoriasis is associated with several comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, lymphoma, and depression. Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease with genetic predisposition, but no distinct immunogen has been identified. The presence of cytokines, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes in psoriatic lesions has prompted the development of biologic therapies. The diagnosis is usually clinical, based on the presence of typical erythematous scaly patches, papules, and plaques that are often pruritic and sometimes painful.

"H01490","Multiple sclerosis","Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by inflammation, demyelination and axonal loss. This disease typically strikes young adults, especially women. There are four types of MS according to their relapsing or progressive pattern that include relapsing-remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS), primary progressive (PPMS), and progressive relapsing (PRMS). In most patients, the disease has a relapsing-remitting course during the first years. Within 10 years, approximately 50% of patients progress to SPMS. The aetiology of MS is not well understood, but it is likely multifactorial, combining both genetic and environmental factors. Recently, the literature on the risk factors for MS has grown substantially. They indicate that a combination of a genetic predisposition, exposure to Epstein-Barr virus, cigarette smoking, and reduced sunlight exposure/vitamin D levels is involved. Authorized first-line treatments are considered equally effective, and include interferon beta and glatiramer acetate. They are primarily directed against inflammation, and might fail to adequately control disease activity in some patients. In that case, it has been recommended to switch these patients early to a therapy of higher efficacy. Currently, 13 different drugs with ten different active components are licensed in the European Union (EU) and the United States (US) for the treatment of MS.","Nervous system disease"

ERD can manifest in a wide range of symptoms which can be subdivided into typical, atypical, and extraesophageal symptoms. Typical symptoms include heartburn and acid regurgitation which have high specificity but low sensitivity for GERD. Atypical symptoms such as epigastric pain, dyspepsia, nausea, bloating, and belching may be suggestive of GERD but may overlap with other conditions in the differential diagnosis. Lastly, there are various extraesophageal symptoms including chronic cough, asthma, laryngitis, and dental erosions. In a small but important minority, complications of peptic oesophagitis may occur including oesophageal strictures, Barrett's oesophagus, and rarely oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Hiatus hernia is statistically associated with GERD, the presence of which is relevant to surgical treatment. The diagnosis is typically made by a combination of clinical symptoms, response to acid suppression, as well as objective testing with upper endoscopy and esophageal pH monitoring. GERD is a chronic disease that typically requires long term management in the form of lifestyle modification, medical therapy and, for a subset of patients, surgical therapy.

"H01408","Periodontal disease","During the early stages of the periodontal disease, saccharolytic, aerobic Streptococcus spp. and other bacteria adhere to and colonize the tooth enamel and root surface. This sets the stage for Fusobacterium nucleatum to coaggregate with these early colonizers and to permit late colonizers, including dental pathogens, to eventually form a biofilm. These complex interactions result in the release of factors that lead to tooth decay. Physical interaction is very specific among various genera in this complex microbial community. Due to the unusual length, adhesive nature, and other cell surface properties of F. nucleatum, periodontal disease-causing bacteria such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Treponema denticola, and Streptococcus spp. aggregate and thrive; hence, F. nucleatum is thought of as a 'bridge bacterium'.","Infectious disease"

PVOD is histologically characterized by intimal fibrosis that narrows and occludes pulmonary veins and it accounts for 5-10% of cases initially thought to be idiopathic PAH (IPAH). PCH is histologically characterized by localized capillary proliferation within the lung in which capillaries invade the pulmonary interstitium, vessels and, less commonly, airways. PCH has been reported to be much less frequent than PVOD. In recent years, PAH-targeted drugs including epoprostenol have improved the survival of patients with IPAH. PVOD/PCH has a very similar clinical presentation to PAH but is characterised by a worse prognosis and the possibility that severe pulmonary oedema can develop with specific PAH therapy.

Hydrolyzed C3 binds factor B. Factor B, when bound to hydrolyzed C3, is cleaved by factor D into Ba and Bb. Hydrolyzed C3Bb is responsible for a constant low level of C3 cleavage into C3b. If C3b binds to an appropriate surface, factor B will bind with C3b to form C3bBb, a highly efficient C3-cleaving enzyme. This overall series of successive proteolytic steps is enhanced by the serum protein properdin, which stabilizes protein:protein interactions during the process. Factor H is essential in controlling the function of the alternative pathway by inhibiting the formation of and degrading C3bBb. Deficiencies of alternative pathway-specific components are rare, and usually lead to an increased frequency of Neisseria infections.","Primary immunodeficiency"

MTLE-HS is restricted to patients in whom hippocampal atrophy and/or abnormal signal intensity on MRI, anterior temporal interictal epileptiform discharges, and additional evidence of temporal dysfunction on functional images and neuro-psychological assessment are demonstrated.Patients with MTLE-HS often have a history of early risk factors such as febrile seizures, status epilepticus (SE) or infection. A seizure-free period may ensue before uncontrolled partial seizures begin. Epileptic focus is located deeply in the mesial temporal region including mainly hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala. The anatomopathological hallmark is sclerosis of the hippocampus. MTLE-HS is restricted to patients in whom hippocampal atrophy and/or abnormal signal intensity on MRI, anterior temporal interictal epileptiform discharges, and additional evidence of temporal dysfunction on functional images and neuro-psychological assessment are demonstrated. Since most of the cases are drug resistant, epilepsy surgery is the current gold standard therapy option for cessation of seizures.

Patients with persistently elevated GH and IGF-I levels have an increased risk of multiple comorbidities, including left ventricular dysfunction, obstructive sleep apnea, arthritis, impaired glucose tolerance, and colonic polyps. Most cases of ACM occur as a result of a sporadic GH-secreting pituitary adenoma (PA). However, ACM can occur in a familial setting, either associated with other endocrine abnormalities or as an isolated disorder. Somatic activating mutations in the GNAS gene, which encodes for the Gs-alpha subunit of G-proteins, are found in up to 40% of sporadic GH-secreting PA. Familial ACM can occur in the context of rare inherited syndromes such as familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA), which is caused in 15-20% of cases by aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) gene germline mutations. Moreover, a recurrent mutation was found in GPR101 in some patients with non-familial ACM.","Endocrine disease"

Sheet-like areas of basement membrane originating from the basal epithelial cells of the corneal epithelium and extending superficially into the epithelium are the hallmarks of EBMD. Most patients are asymptomatic before the age of 30 years, but 10% of them may have recurrent idiopathic erosions and a loss of vision due to surface irregularity.","Nervous system disease"
"H01645","Hyperthyroidism","Hyperthyroidism is a pathological disorder characterised by increased thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion from the thyroid gland. The term thyrotoxicosis is not synonymous with hyperthyroidism. Thyrotoxicosis is defined as the clinical syndrome of hypermetabolism resulting from increased thyroid hormone levels, irrespective of the source. The causes of hyperthyroidism include Graves' disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and solitary toxic adenoma. Less common causes of hyperthyroidism include thyrotropin-induced thyrotoxicosis and trophoblastic tumours. The causes of thyrotoxicosis without hyperthyroidism are less common and generally transient. In patients with silent thyroiditis, post-partum thyroiditis, or subacute painful thyroiditis, the destruction of thyrocytes leads to release of preformed hormones into the circulation. Drug-induced thyrotoxicosis has the same pathogenic mechanism as thyroiditis. Exogenous thyrotoxicosis develops after ingestion of excessive amounts of thyroid hormone, and is associated with low serum thyroglobulin concentrations. Patients of hyperthyroidism/thyrotoxicosis usually have fatigue, nervousness or anxiety, weight loss, palpitations, and heat sensitivity. Clinical findings almost always include tachycardia, warm moist skin, the presence of an enlarged thyroid, and a slight tremor. The three options for treating patients with hyperthyroidism are antithyroid drugs (ATDs), radioactive iodine ablation, and surgery. All three therapeutic options would be effective in the treatment of patients with Graves' disease, whereas patients with toxic adenoma or toxic multinodular goiter should have either radioactive iodine therapy or surgery, since these patients rarely go into remission. In patients with toxic nodular goiter, ATDs are generally used to restore euthyroidism before definitive treatment with surgery or radioactive iodine, and infrequently used as long-term treatment when the other two therapies are contraindicated or the patient has a short life expectancy.","Endocrine disease"

"H01448","Hoarding disorder","Hoarding disorder is characterized by persistent difficulty discarding possessions, regardless of the value others may attribute to these possessions. They accumulate a large number of possessions that often fill up or clutter active living areas of the home or workplace to the extent that their intended use is no longer possible. Previously, hoarding has been treated as a typical obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptom, using first-line pharmacological and psychological treatments for OCD, however, the results have not been robust. Clinical trial evidence suggests that OCD patients with hoarding symptoms are less responsive to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) than those without hoarding symptoms. On the other hand, hoarding and non-hoarding OCD patients fared equally well in one open trial of paroxetine.","Mental and behavioural disorder"
"H01810","Congenital myopathy","The congenital myopathies are a group of genetic muscle disorders characterised clinically by hypotonia and weakness, usually from birth, and a static or slowly progressive clinical course. Congenital myopathies are mainly defined by the predominant histopathological features which include nemaline rods, central cores, multiple minicores, central nuclei, and selective hypotrophy of type 1 fibres. Based on these features, individual congenital myopathies such as nemaline myopathy, central core disease, multi-minicore disease, centronuclear myopathy, and congenital fiber type disproportion were reported. Over the past decade there have been major advances in defining the genetic basis of the majority of congenital myopathy subtypes. However the relationship between each congenital myopathy, defined on histological grounds, and the genetic cause is complex. Many of the congenital myopathies are due to mutations in more than one gene, and mutations in the same gene can cause different muscle pathologies.","Nervous system disease; Musculoskeletal disease"
"H01470","Giant cell tumor of bone","Giant-cell tumor of bone (GCTB) is a rare osteolytic tumor of the bone. Although classified as a benign tumor, GCTB is characterized by local aggressiveness and risk of local recurrence. Its name is derived from the numerous multinucleated giant cells found within the tumor, which are principally responsible for the extensive bone resorption that is characteristic of GCTB. However, the neoplastic components of GCTB are the spindle-like stromal cells, which produce RANKL that recruits monocytic osteoclast precursors from blood to the tumor, and stimulates differentiation into multinucleated giant cells. Recently, denosumab (RANKL inhibitor) has become a new treatment option for locally advanced GCTB.","Skeletal diseases"
"H01642","Renal anemia","Renal anemia is one of the most frequent complications of chronic kidney disease. Anemia leads to a decrease in oxygen delivery to vital organs, which is initially compensated for by tachycardia and cardiac hypertrophy, but eventually leads to the development of cardiovascular disease. Renal anemia is caused by the deficiency of endogenous erythropoietin (EPO) due to renal dysfunction. EPO is a glycoprotein hormone that has the role of the primary regulator of erythropoiesis. Formerly, treatment options were essentially limited to blood transfusions and androgen therapy, with its risks. However, since the late 1980s, the availability of recombinant human erythropoietin has revolutionized the management of renal anemia, and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are now the mostly widely used drugs.","Urinary system disease"

"H01621","Pulmonary arterial hypertension","Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive disorder in which endothelial dysfunction and vascular remodeling obstruct small pulmonary arteries, resulting in increased pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary pressures. This leads to reduced cardiac output, right heart failure, and ultimately death. PAH is divided into disease subgroups that include heritable (HPAH, formerly familial PAH), idiopathic (IPAH), and PAH associated with a variety of other systemic diseases or drug/toxin exposures. It has been discovered that altered BMPR2 signaling is the major heritable risk factor for development of PAH, via rare variants (mutations) in the BMPR2 gene (coding for a type II receptor member of the transforming growth factor [TGF]-beta family). Pathogenic mutations in the type I receptor ACVRL1 and, at a significantly lower frequency, the type III receptor endoglin in multiple kindreds cause PAH associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Together, these observations support a prominent role for TGF-beta family members in the development of PAH.","Cardiovascular disease"
"H01873","Obliterative bronchiolitis","Obliterative bronchiolitis (OB), also known as bronchiolitis obliterans, is a rare but serious condition resulting in progressive and irreversible airway obstruction. This disease is the result of injury to the respiratory and terminal bronchioles from a wide variety of potential causes. Although the pathogenesis of OB remains poorly understood, it seems clear that a multifaceted process of inflammation and resultant fibrotic transition occurs, resulting in airflow limitation and development of disease. Although OB has been described in all age groups, the frequency of underlying causes and potential prognoses are different for children and adults. For example, OB in children is most often seen following a severe lower-respiratory-tract infection, usually of adenovirus, whereas OB in adults is more commonly associated with occupational inhalation injuries, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and autoimmune disorders. In lung transplant recipients, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome is the major cause of death after the first year of transplantation and is a form of allograft rejection. There is no uniformly accepted treatment protocol for patients with OB. Many patients are tried on corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants based on anecdotal evidence of improvement. However, these medications have significant toxicity.","Respiratory disease"

Symptoms include discomfort, numbness, intermittent claudication, or even gangrene and ulceration. The risk factors of ASO include age, male gender, smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, and hyperhomocysteinemia. There are no definitive treatments for ASO. The efficacy of surgical treatment is not satisfactory, and medication is required to maintain the postoperative vascular patency. In order to relieve symptoms such as cold sensation and intermittent claudication, drug therapy such as antiplatelet therapy and vasodilatory drugs are useful in the treatment of some patients with ASO. Adsorption of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) has also been applied for the treatment of ASO. At present, the diagnosis of ASO depends on several clinical tests, such as angiography, estimations of ankle/brachial index (ABI), and pulse-wave velocity (PWV), as well as the measurement of circulating hs-CRP levels. However, these examinations can only be detectable when ASO already developed, and there was no predictable markers for ASO in its earlier stages.

Although histologically benign, these lesions may expand into surrounding tissues and/or infiltrate vital structures similar to malignancies, sometimes causing life-threatening complications. The etiology of lymphangioma is not certain. The presence of lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC)-specific markers on the endothelial lining of lymphangiomas (e.g. the transcription factor Prox1) indicates that the neoplasm may result from transformed LECs and/or stromal cells. This transformation is modulated by VEGF-C, a specific lymphatic endothelial growth factor, and its receptor VEGFR-3.","Vascular disease"

Additional genes associated with the disease have been identified.","Immune system disease"
"H00568","Myotonic dystrophy","Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is a complex multisystemic disorder linked to two different genetic loci. DM1 is caused by an expansion of a CTG repeat located in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of DMPK. DM2 is caused by an unstable CCTG repeat in intron 1 of ZNF9. Therefore, both DMs are caused by a repeat expansion in a region transcribed into RNA but not translated into protein. The mutant RNA transcripts aberrantly affect the splicing of the same target RNAs, such as chloride channel 1 (ClC-1) and insulin receptor (INSR), resulting in their shared myotonia and insulin resistance. Affected individuals express highly heterogeneous, multisystemic symptoms including myotonia (muscle hyperexcitability), progressive muscle weakness and wasting, cataract development, testicular atrophy, and cardiac conduction defects. It has an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance and disease severity generally correlates with repeat length.","Nervous system disease; Musculoskeletal disease"
"H01688","Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis","Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) or crescentic glomerulonephritis is a life-threatening disease that destroys kidneys over a period of days to weeks. Proliferation of epithelial cells and infiltration of inflammatory cells lead to glomerular crescent formation and disruption of the specialized microvascular network in the glomerulus. This causes hematuria, albuminuria and loss of renal function. From an immunopathologic standpoint, primary RPGN is divided into pauci-immune GN (PIGN), anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody (anti-GBM) GN, and immune complex GN. PIGN, the most common etiology of primary RPGN, refers to a necrotizing glomerulonephritis with few or no immune deposits by immunofluorescence or electron microscopy. Approximately 90% of patients with PICG have circulating ANCA antibodies, leading to the systemic small vessel vasculitis such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). Corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide are the first-line treatment, but infection is the most common cause of death of RPGN patients. Several new treatment strategies, such as leukocytaphereis (LCAP) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), have become available and these treatments have made it possible to treat high-risk RPGN patients without inducing serious immunosuppressive states.","Urinary system disease"

The main characteristics are brachycephaly, wide fontanels, prominent forehead, hypertelorism, prominent eyes, macrocornea with or without glaucoma, small chin, bowing of the long bones, and flexion deformity of the fingers. The most common underlying genetic defect in FTHS appears to be a mutation in the SH3PXD2B gene. Patients appeared to share many of the craniofacial and skeletal features normally associated with Melnick-Needles syndrome. However the autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance and congenital cardiac defects distinguished the syndrome as a separate entity.","Congenital malformation"

It is among the most common ocular conditions affecting both children and adults. The etiology is complex and not fully understood, but the general consensus is that bacteria and inflammation contribute to the pathology. Blepharitis can be classified into anterior blepharitis and posterior blepharitis. Anterior blepharitis describes inflammation of the eyelid skin and eyelash follicles and may be accompanied by squamous debris or collarettes. Anterior blepharitis has classically been associated with Staphylococcus infection and seborrheic dermatitis. Posterior blepharitis describes inflammation of the meibomian glands and their orifices and may be a result of or cause of meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). MGD is one cause of posterior blepharitis but others include infectious or allergic conjunctivitis, and rosacea. The diagnosis of blepharitis is almost always based on the history and clinical examination. Long-term management of symptoms may include daily eyelid cleansing routines and the use of therapeutic agents that reduce infection and inflammation. Recent clinical trials have shown that antibiotics and topical corticosteroids can produce significant improvement in signs and symptoms of blepharitis.","Nervous system disease"

"H01482","Infantile hemangioma","Infantile hemangiomas (IH) are neoplastic proliferations of vascular endothelial cells (ECs), characterized by a period of growth after birth, and eventual spontaneous involution. Forty percent of the lesions are associated with complications such as ulceration, bleeding, infection, pain, cardiac failure, airway compromise or eye impairment. Pathogenesis of IH is still shrouded in mystery even though various theories have been postulated to explain its origin. Recent studies provide strong evidence for the conclusion that the VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and Tumor Endothelial Marker 8 (TEM8) mutations represent risk factor mutations for hemangioma formation. In the proliferating phase, constitutive VEGFR2 signaling in ECs from hemangioma lesions affects downstream processes, including EC proliferation and migration, providing a mechanistic explanation for the rapid endothelial proliferation seen in hemangioma.","Vascular disease"

"H01449","Excoriation disorder","Excoriation Disorder, also known as Skin Picking Disorder, is characterized by the repetitive and compulsive scratching or picking of skin, which causes tissue damage. Patients spend a significant amount of time each day picking their skin, that causes psychosocial impairment. Triggers to pick vary greatly. For example, stress, anxiety, boredom, and feeling tired or angry have all been reported as triggers. Co-occurring psychiatric conditions are common in this disease. The most commonly reported comorbid conditions are trichotillomania, substance dependence, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). So far, there is no clear neurobiological explanation for the etiology of this disease. Recent research showed bilateral abnormalities in the anterior cingulate cortex and abnormalities on the left temporoparietal junction. Another study has shown deficits in motor inhibition, which appears to be correlated with frontal cortex abnormalities. Furthermore, severity of excoriation disorder may be associated with higher levels of impulsivity. Treatment for this disease has largely focused on cognitive behavioral therapy and pharmacology. Early psychosocial treatment studies provided evidence for skin picking reduction with habit reversal or acceptance-enhanced behavior therapy (AEBT). The data for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) efficacy in this disease are not convincing, although some studies suggested that fluoxetine is effective. Tricyclic antidepressants, neuroleptics, and the dopamine-blocking opioid antagonist have also been found to be effective for skin-picking.","Mental and behavioural disorder"

Central precocious puberty (CEPREPU) refers to a gonadotropin-dependent type which results from premature activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG). CEPREPU is much more frequent in girls than in boys (up to 20:1 ratio). Recently, kisspeptin receptor (KISS1R) and its ligand, kisspeptin, were revealed as major gatekeepers of puberty onset. Mutations of the KISS1R gene were described in patients with impaired pubertal development. On the other hand, it has been reported that heterozygous mutations of the LHCGR gene cause gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty in males, but have no detectable effects on prepubertal or postpubertal females.","Endocrine disease"
"H00339","Botulism","Botulism is an acute neuroparalytic illness caused by a botulinum toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum, an anaerobic, gram-positive bacterium. Botulism occurs in four forms: foodborne, wound, infant botulism, and adult intestinal toxemia. Botulinum toxin blocks acetylcholine release in a dose-dependent fashion, resulting in symmetrical, descending, and progressive muscle weakness. Delay in treatment may allow progression of paralysis.","Infectious disease"
"H02238","Spinal muscular atrophy with congenital bone fractures","Spinal muscular atrophy with congenital bone fractures (SMABF) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder. Affected individuals presented with prenatal-onset spinal muscular atrophy, multiple congenital contractures, respiratory distress, and congenital bone fractures.

"H01440","Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis","Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis, also known as Trench mouth, Vincent angina and Vincent gingivitis is an acute bacterial infection of the gingiva caused by spirochetes, fusiform bacteria, or an overgrowth of normal oral flora. Predisposing factors include poor oral hygiene, advancing age, impaired nutritional status, smoking or chewing tobacco, immunosuppression, preexisting gingivitis, extreme stress, or lack of sleep. If the symptom progresses, the periodontium may be destroyed. Possible systemic manifestations include fever, anorexia, weakness, and fatigue.","Infectious disease"
"H01672","Juvenile idiopathic arthritis","Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is one of the most common childhood rheumatic diseases. Clinically, it is defined as arthritis of unknown origin that starts before the age of 16, and persists for at least 6 weeks. Next to a certain genetic predisposition, environmental factors play a role leading to a chronic inflammatory response. JIA is not a single disorder but consists of a heterogeneous group of auto-immune inflammatory diseases. It has variable rates in course and activity of disease. Based on 6 months of clinical symptoms and global prognostic factors, the following clinical subtypes of JIA are recognized: systemic JIA, oligoarthritis, RF-negative polyarthritis, RF-positive polyarthritis, psoriatic JIA, enthesitis- related arthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis. Systemic JIA, also known as Still's disease, is a subtype with strong systemic clinical symptoms. Patients with systemic JIA have, in addition to arthritis, prominent symptoms of systemic inflammation such as spiking fever, rash, pericarditis, peritonitis, lymphadenopathy and organomegaly. A severe and often life-threatening complication occurring in 10-30% of patients with systemic JIA is macrophage activation syndrome. Polymorphisms in the IL6 and in the MIF gene have been found to be associated with susceptibility to the disorder. Based on the known relevance of IL6 in JIA pathophysiology, tocilizumab has been investigated and approved for use in the treatment of systemic and polyarticular JIA.","Immune system disease"
"H02493","Al Kaissi syndrome","Al Kaissi syndrome (ALKAS) is an autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by growth retardation, spine malformation, facial dysmorphism, and developmental delay.

"H00330","Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcal aureus (MRSA) infection","Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of the major multidrug-resistant bacteria which have become endemic in the hospital environment, particularly in intensive care units (ICUs). Originally limited to the hospital setting, MRSA is a growing cause of infections in the community. Community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) strains are genetically different from MRSA strains originating in the hospital. Its increase in the community is of concern because CA-MRSA strains appear to be highly virulent, and colonization with CA-MRSA is often undetected in hospitalized patients, which can facilitate its potential for becoming resistant to multiple antibiotics. Health care-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) is usually associated with pneumonia, urinary tract, blood stream, and surgical wound infections. In contrast, CA-MRSA strains are overwhelmingly associated with skin and soft tissue infections.","Infectious disease"
"H00102","Classic complement pathway component defects","Complement disorders account for only 2 percent of all primary immunodeficiency disorders. They result from the disruption of one of the proteins involved in the classic or nonclassic activation pathways of the complement response. Defects in the classic pathway account for the more common type of complement deficiency, and are associated with increased risk to develop systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and SLE-like diseases. Homozygous C2 deficiency, which is the most frequent hereditary deficiency in complement classical pathway components, is associated with SLE in 10% of the cases. Complete C1q and C4 deficiencies are less frequent but associated with a higher prevalence of SLE.","Primary immunodeficiency"

"H01686","Idiopathic portal hypertension","Idiopathic portal hypertension (IPH) is a disorder generally classified as a noncirrhotic portal hypertension of unknown etiology, and is clinically characterized by portal hypertension, splenomegaly, and pancytopenia. The principal pathologic changes of IPH are devastation of the intrahepatic terminal portal radicles with considerable portal fibrosis and secondary atrophy of the liver parenchyma that follows portal thrombosis. The incidence varies considerably with the country. In contrast to its high prevalence in India, IPH is comparatively a rare disorder in Western countries. Middle-aged women are more prone to IPH in Japan. IPH usually suggests a benign prognosis, but sometimes is complicated with severe hemorrhage due to ruptured esophageal varices, or massive splenomegaly. It is mainly managed by supportive treatment such as endoscopic, radiological and/or surgical management for esophageal varices and/or splenomegaly. The definite etiology of IPH is still uncertain, but there are several theories on the potential pathogenesis of IPH. These theories include immunological disorders, infections, and genetic variants.","Liver disease"

"H01229","Inclusion body myopathy 3","Inclusion body myopathy 3 (IBM3) is an autosomal dominant myopathy associated with a heterozygous missense mutation in the myosin heavy chain (MyHC) IIa gene (MYH2), changing the highly conserved and negatively charged glutamate at position 706 to the positively charged lysine (E706K). This region is important for myosin functioning during muscle contraction, because it undergoes conformational changes during adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis. Clinical characteristics include congenital joint contractures, a progressive course in adulthood, and external ophthalmoplegia.","Nervous system disease; Musculoskeletal disease"
"H00559","von Hippel-Lindau syndrome","von Hippel-Lindau syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with tumors in the central nervous system and other organs. The most frequent tumors are cerebellar and retinal haemangioblastomas, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, renal cell carcinoma, phaeochromocytoma in the adrenal gland, epididymal cystadenoma, and endolymphatic sac tumours. Germline inactivation of VHL tumor suppressor protein leads to the upregulation of HIF and promotes to carcinogenesis.","Congenital malformation"
"H00901","Cystinuria","Cystinuria is a inherited disorder of re-absorptive transport of cystine and the dibasic amino acids ornithine, arginine and lysine in the proximal tubule and small intestine. Diagnostically, urinary levels of dibasic amino acids lysine, arginine, and ornithine, and most prominently, of cystine are constantly elevated. Plasma levels of these amino acids in general are at the lower end of the normal range. Patients with cystinuria often present with nephro- or urolithiasis at almost at any age with a clear preference in childhood due to elevated urinary cystine. Early diagnosis is important, as it allows prevention or diminution of kidney stones. Mutations in either interacting subunit SLC3A1 (rBAT) or SLC7A9 (b0,+AT) cause cystinuria. Cystinuria due to mutations in SLC3A1 is an autosomal recessive trait, whereas mutations in SLC7A9 can be seen as an autosomal dominant trait.","Inherited metabolic disease; Urinary system disease; Kidney disease"
"H02458","Hydrocephalus due to congenital stenosis of aqueduct of sylvius","Hydrocephalus due to congenital stenosis of aqueduct of sylvius (HSAS) is a rare X-linked disease characterized by severe hydrocephaly.

"H01681","Acute pancreatitis","Acute pancreatitis ranges from a mild, self- limiting disease to a life-threatening condition with multiple organ failure. Abdominal pain is the predominant symptom. Nausea and vomiting may accompany the pain. Patients frequently have a low-grade fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. The most common causes of acute pancreatitis are alcohol abuse and gallstones. The currently accepted pathogenic mechanism includes autodigestion and acute inflammation of the pancreas by the activation of proteases of the pancreas and acute inflammatory cells. Severe acute pancreatitis is defined by the presence of organ failure persisting beyond 48 hour. Organ failure that develops during the early phase is set in motion by the activation of cytokine cascades resulting in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Although effective therapies for acute pancreatitis are still limited, protease inhibitors have been considered to be a potential treatment to inhibit the pancreatic inflammation.","Pancreas disease"
"H00561","Brachydactyly-mental retardation syndrome","Brachydactyly mental retardation syndrome (BDMR), also known as Albright hereditary osteodystrophy-like syndrome, is a complex disorder characterized by brachydactyly and mental retardation including autism spectrum disorder. It has been confirmed that this disease is associated with some deletions of 2q37. Individuals with BDMR and Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) have very similar features. Mutation of the BDMR-causative gene HDAC4 results in reduced expression of RAI1, whose haploinsufficiency leads to SMS.","Chromosomal abnormality"
"H02236","Keppen-Lubinsky syndrome","Keppen-Lubinsky syndrome (KPLBS) is a rare condition characterized by severely reduced facial adipose tissue and thin facial skin combined with severe developmental delay and hypertonia. KPLBS is caused by mutations in KCNJ6, which encodes an inwardly rectifying potassium channel.","Congenital disorder of metabolism"
"H00105","Mannose-binding lectin pathway component defects","There is an increasing number of clinical studies indicating that deficiency of the lectin pathway has been associated with an increased risk, severity, and frequency of infections but also autoimmune disorders. MBL deficiency is one of the most common human immunodeficiencies and arises primarily from three single point mutations in exon 1 of the MBL-2 gene. These mutations result in a failure to assemble fully functional multimeric protein. Inherited MASP-2 deficiency has been described as the result of a mutation causing the exchange of aspartic acid with a glycine at position 105, a position in the first domain, CUB1, involved in calcium binding. This mutation abolishes the binding to MBL and ficolins, and deprives MASP-2 of functional activity.","Primary immunodeficiency"

"H01211","MECP2-related severe neonatal encephalopathy","MECP2-related severe neonatal encephalopathy is a rare disorder of males characterized by a static encephalopathy, severe developmental delays, hypotonia, seizures, and respiratory abnormalities that often leads to death at an early age. Mutations in the MECP2 gene cause this disease, and females with these same mutations typically have a disorder called Rett syndrome. Most boys with this disorder have been identified because they have female siblings with Rett syndrome.","Congenital malformation"
"H01675","Syringomyelia","Syringomyelia is a spinal disorder characterized by the presence of abnormal fluid-filled cavities within the spinal cord. Early symptoms include headache, altered pain and temperature sensation, and paresthesia. If fluid continues to enlarge the cyst, the syrinx has the potential to compress or destroy the affected portions of the spinal cord. Surgical intervention is typically recommended to treat this condition, although a successful procedure often is limited to providing minimal neurological improvement or simply halting the deterioration. The term syringomyelia describes many pathogenetically different disorders. A popular broad grouping is a classification based on the assumed pathogenesis and association with other disorders. It has been proposed to divide the disorder into three subgroups. (1) Syringomyelia as a result of changed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow dynamics related to hindbrain disorders, e.g. Chiari malformation, Dandy-Walker syndrome, arachnoiditis or osseous abnormalities. (2) Syringomyelia as a result of intramedullary tissue damage caused by haemorrhage or infarction. (3) Syringomyelia as a result of intramedullary tumour with secretory capabilities. Other proposed classifications are based on syrinx fluid composition, central canal communication between syrinx and the fourth ventricle, or the microanatomical localisation of the syrinx.","Congenital malformation"
"H00595","Myofibrillar myopathies","Myofibrillar myopathy (MFM) is a group of genetically distinct disorders linked by common morphologic features observed on muscle histology. MFM is characterized by slowly progressive weakness that can involve both proximal and distal muscles. Distal muscle weakness is more pronounced than proximal weakness. All disease proteins identified to date are involved in maintaining the structural integrity of the Z-disk. The pathology includes accumulations of these proteins irrespective of primary gene defect, suggesting that these share molecular pathways involved in actin dynamics organized by the Z-disk. Besides accumulations of these proteins, congophilic amyloid products of myofibrillar degradation and ectopic aggregation of dystrophin and gelsolin appear in abnormal myofibers.","Nervous system disease; Musculoskeletal disease"
"H01447","Body dysmorphic disorder","Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a psychiatric disorder in which individuals are preoccupied with imagined defects in their appearance, which are not noticeable or appear slight to others. It is characterized by time-consuming behaviors such as mirror gazing, comparing one's appearance with the appearance of others, excessive camouflaging to hide the defect, and seeking reassurance. Patients experience significant distress, disability, and functional impairment, often accompanied by depression and suicidality. There is some clinical and pathologic overlap between obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and BDD such as obsessive thoughts and the performance of ritual behavior. Patients with BDD respond to treatment with serotonergic agents such as clomipramine or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which suggests a dysfunction of central serotonergic neurotransmission as a possible etiological factor. A recent study suggests that cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) was more effective than treatment with medications.","Mental and behavioural disorder"
"H00308","Vibrio vulnificus infection","Vibrio vulnificus is a gram-negative bacillus found in warm coastal waters.

Patients have decreased or absent pre-beta lipoproteins consisting of very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL).","Nervous system disease"
"H01478","Machado-Joseph disease","Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), also known as spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), is one of the most common hereditary ataxias and is distributed worldwide. MJD is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder, involving predominantly the cerebellar, pyramidal, extrapyramidal, motor neuron and oculomotor systems. Minor, but more specific, features such as external progressive ophthalmoplegia (EPO), dystonia, intention fasciculation-like movements of facial and lingual muscles, as well as bulging eyes, may also be of major importance for the clinical diagnosis of MJD. The mean age at onset is around 40 years. MJD is associated with CAG repeat expansions in the ATXN3 gene. CAG repeat varies in size among affected persons. There is no effective treatment of ataxia. Case series and small controlled trials of several medications including antianxiolytics, antidepressants, and antiepileptics have shown limited efficacy.","Neurodegenerative disease"
"H00798","Familial carpal tunnel syndrome","Carpal tunnel syndrome is an entrapment neuropathy of the median nerve characterized by paresthesias in the district of the median nerve. Familial carpal tunnel syndrome is an extremely rare form with bilateral symptom that is frequently associated with inherited systemic disorders such as mucopolysaccharidosis, mucolipidosis, amyloidosis, collagen vascular disease or hereditary liability to pressure palsies. The cause of the disease is the compression of the median nerve by thickened transverse carpal ligament. Mutations in transthyretin, a gene that plays a role in deposition of amyloid, have been reported.","Nervous system disease"
"H01820","Carney complex","Carney complex (CNC) is a rare multiple neoplasia syndrome characterized by pigmented lesions of the skin and mucosa, cardiac, cutaneous and other myxomas, and multiple endocrine tumors. Further manifestations include primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD) [DS:H00260] leading to Cushing's syndrome [DS:H01431], pituitary adenomas [DS:H01102], thyroid nodules, testicular neoplasms, ovarian cysts, psammomatous melanotic schwannomas, ductal breast adenomas and osteochondromyxomas. Most CNC patients initially present with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-independent Cushing's syndrome due to PPNAD or heart myxomas. Skin lesions are the most common CNC manifestation: lentigines are present in 70 to 75% of patients with CNC. Blue nevi are also typical of CNC. CNC is caused by inactivating mutations or large deletions of the PRKAR1A gene coding for the regulatory subunit type I alpha of protein kinase A (PKA). It may be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait but in a significant number of patients the disease is sporadic, presumably due to de novo mutations.","Other disease"

"H01707","Ossified ligamentum flavum","Ossified ligamentum flavum (OLF) is a condition of heterotopic lamellar bone formation within the yellow ligament. OLF is a widely described pathology in eastern Asia and rare in other parts of the world. The disease process first causes hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum and subsequent ossification, which narrows the spinal canal and leads to myeloradiculopathy. The lower thoracic spine is most commonly affected. Previous hyperkyphosis and mechanical stress are thought to be predisposing conditions. It is tempting to think that OLF is genetically or pathologically inherited based on abnormalities of calcium or phosphate metabolism, on endocrinologic abnormalities, or on the presence of autoimmune disease. Such relationships, however, have not been documented. Treatment of cervical stenosis related to OLF is based on the standard principle of managing neural spinal abnormalities. Acute episodes of pain and onset of or increase in neurological deficits are treated with rest, external spinal immobilization with a collar or brace, and analgesics, anti-inflammatory, and/or antispasmodic medicines. Surgery is indicated for patients with acute or chronic progression of neurological deficits or persistent neurological deficits.","Musculoskeletal disease"

"H00083","Allograft rejection","Allograft rejection is the consequence of the recipient's alloimmune response to nonself antigens expressed by donor tissues. After transplantation of organ allografts, there are two pathways of antigen presentation. In the direct pathway, recipient T cells react to intact allogeneic MHC molecules expressed on the surface of donor cells. This pathway would activate host CD4 or CD8 T cells. In contrast, donor MHC molecules (and all other proteins) shed from the graft can be taken up by host APCs and presented to recipient T cells in the context of self-MHC molecules - the indirect pathway. Such presentation activates predominantly CD4 T cells. A direct cytotoxic T-cell attack on graft cells can be made only by T cells that recognize the graft MHC molecules directly. Nontheless, T cells with indirect allospecificity can contribute to graft rejection by activating macrophages, which cause tissue injury and fibrosis, and are also likely to be important in the development of an alloantibody response to graft.","Immune system disease"

GVHD pathophysiology can be summerized in a three-step process. Step 1 involves the development of an inflammatory milieu resulting from damage in the host tissues induced by the preparative chemotherapy or radiotherapy regimen. Damaged tissues secrete inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 1 (IL-1), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha ). During step 2, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) trigger the activation of donor-derived T cells, which induce further T-cell expansion, induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells responses and prime additional mononuclear phagocytes to produce TNF-alpha and IL-1. Also, nitric oxide (NO) is produced by activated macrophages, and it may contribute to the tissue damage seen during step 3.

"H01700","Hypopituitarism","Hypopituitarism is a chronic endocrine illness, and is the partial or complete insufficiency of anterior pituitary hormone secretion. Anterior pituitary is composed of five cell types that secrete growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and corticotropin hormone (ACTH). Clinical manifestations of hypopituitarism are variable, often insidious in onset and dependent on the degree and severity of hormone deficiency. However, it is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. A variety of diseases may cause hypopituitarism and, accordingly, this disorder can be divided into two types depending on its cause. Primary hypopituitarism is caused by disorders of the pituitary gland itself and may be due to the loss, damage, or dysfunction of pituitary hormone-secreting cells. On the other hand, secondary hypopituitarism is the result of diseases of the hypothalamus or pituitary stalk interrupting the nerve or vascular connections to the pituitary gland, thereby reducing the secretion of the pituitary hormones. Hypopituitarism can be easily diagnosed by measuring basal pituitary and target hormone levels. MR imaging of the hypothalamo-pituitary region may provide essential information. The most common causes of primary hypopituitarism are pituitary adenoma and complications from surgery or radiation therapy for the treatment of pituitary adenoma. In rare cases, hypopituitarism has been observed when the infection occurs. Sheehan's syndrome is hypopituitarism caused by the postpartum hemorrhage of the pituitary gland. In still rarer cases, solitary or complicated pituitary hormone deficiency syndromes may occur due to genetic causes and typically affect children. The treatment of hypopituitarism typically involves a replacement of the deficient hormone but care must be taken because several studies have reported an increased incidence of cardiovascular disorders and number of deaths among these patients.","Endocrine disease"

"H00079","Asthma","Asthma is a complex syndrome with many clinical phenotypes in both adults and children. Its major characteristics include a variable degree of airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. Inhaled allergens encounter antigen presenting cells (APC) that line the airway. Upon recognition of the antigen and activation by APC, naive T cells differentiate into TH2 cells. Activated TH2 stimulate the formation of IgE by B cells. IgE molecules bind to IgE receptors located on mast cells. The crosslinking of mast-cell-bound IgE by allergens leads to the release of biologically active mediators (histamine, leukotrienes) by means of degranulation and, so, to the immediate symptoms of allergy. Mast cells also release chemotactic factors that contribute to the recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, whose proliferation and differentiation from bone marrow progenitors is promoted by IL-5. The activation of eosinophils leads to release of toxic granules and oxygen free radicals that lead to tissue damage and promote the development of chronic inflammation.","Immune system disease"

"H01709","Glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis","Glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis is a common and severe adverse event. Glucocorticoid use is one of the most important causes of osteonecrosis. In patients receiving long-term therapy, glucocorticoids induce fractures in 30 to 50% and osteonecrosis in 9 to 40%. The pathogenesis of glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis is not fully understood but postulated mechanisms include hyperlipidemia, fat emboli and intravascular coagulation that reduce the supply of blood to the bones. Since not all patients who are treated with steroids develop osteonecrosis, the presence of additional risk factors or individual variation of glucocorticoids sensitivity has been suggested. The risks of this disease include advancing age, prolonged duration of treatment, increased daily dosage and cumulative dose, low body mass index, underlying disease, and polymorphisms in the glucocorticoid receptor. Bisphosphonates are first-line options for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis and may also be useful in glucocorticoid-induced osteonecrosis. It has been indicated that bisphosphonates may rapidly reduce pain, and delay joint collapse in patients with osteonecrosis.","Musculoskeletal disease"

"H00425","Lysosomal cysteine protease deficiencies","Defects in lysosomal cysteine proteases (Cathepsins) are autosomal recessive lysosomal storage diseases. To date only following two human diseases cathepsin deficiencies have been described, though there are eleven lysosomal cystein proteases. Deficiency of cathepsin C leads to Papillon-Lefevre syndrome characterized by palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and severe early onset periodontitis. Deficiency of cathepsin K leads to pycnodysostosis characterized by osteosclerosis and short stature. Recent findings suggest a more expanded role for cathepsins in human biology.","Inherited metabolic disease; Congenital malformation"
"H00041","Kaposi sarcoma","Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is an angioproliferative disease classified into classic KS, endemic KS, iatrogenic KS, and HIV-associated KS (HIV-KS), however, share the same histological traits and are all associated with infection by the human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8; also known as KSHV). Evidence indicates that KS progression occurs upon the deregulated expression of anti-apoptotic genes (Bcl-2), oncogenes (c-myc, c-int, ras) and oncosuppressor genes (TP53), and is associated with the long-lasting expression of HHV8 latency genes (LANA, v-cyc D, v-FLIP, Kaposin). All these genes are, in fact, expressed or altered in most KS spindle cells in the nodular-late stage of KS. Bcl-2 acts as a major KS progression factor, and TP53 and c-myc may also have a role in disease progression. HHV8 latency gene products may be involved in KS progression due to their capability of promoting cell growth by direct effects or antiapoptotic effects.","Cancer"
"H01193","Familial tumoral calcinosis","Familial tumoral calcinosis (FTC) refers to a group of disorders inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, distinguished by the development of ectopic and vascular calcified masses that occur in settings of hyperphosphatemia (hFTC) and normophosphatemia (nFTC). hFTC is characterized by increased re-absorption of phosphate through the renal proximal tubule, resulting in elevated phosphate concentration and deposition of calcified deposits in cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues, occasionally, in visceral organs. hFTC has been shown to result from mutations in three genes: fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23), KL encoding Klotho, and GALNT3, which encodes a glycosyltransferase responsible for FGF23 O-glycosylation; defective function of any one of these three proteins results in hyperphosphatemia and ectopic calcification. nFTC is characterized by absence of metabolic abnormalities. nFTC has been found to be associated with absence of functional SAMD9, a putative tumor suppressor and anti-inflammatory protein.","Inherited metabolic disease"
"H00273","Pycnodysostosis","Pycnodysostosis is an autosomal recessive skeletal disorder caused by deficiency of cathepsin K in the metabolism of the skeletal system, causing defects in bone resorption and bone remodeling.

"H01133","Reynolds syndrome","Reynolds syndrome is a rare disease associating primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and systemic scleroderma (SSc). It is typically classified as an autoimmune disorder since there are specific autoantibodies associated with both facets of the disease (antimitochondrial antibodies for PBC and anticentromere/antitopoisomerase for SSc), and suggestive microscopical abnormalities in the skin and liver. A mutation in the Lamin B receptor gene has been discovered in the white blood cells, suggesting that nuclear signalling defects could be a cause in Reynolds syndrome.","Skin and connective tissue disease; Digestive disease"
"H01557","Hepatic angiosarcoma","Angiosarcoma represents 1 to 2% of soft tissue tumors. It originates from endothelial cells of small blood vessels and may affect a variety of organs, including the retroperitoneum, skeletal muscle, subcutis, liver, heart and breast. Primary hepatic angiosarcomas (HAS) are much rare tumors, with worse prognosis compared with other angiosarcomas. HAS has been found to be caused by occupational exposure to vinyl chloride (VC) monomer since 1970, and the number of VC-associated HAS cases reported up to the end of 1998 was 197 worldwide. Exposure of VC connects with a series of mechanistic events leading to carcinogenic outcome; mutations of K-ras and p53 are also detected.","Cancer"

Both autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant inheritance have been described. The phenotypic presentation in both types of RS overlaps; however, subtle variances in the severity of craniofacial, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and urogenital characteristics may be present. In general, autosomal recessive RS (RRS) patients have more severe dysmorphology than autosomal dominant RS (DRS), especially in the musculoskeletal system.","Congenital malformation"
"H01765","Eosinophilic sinusitis","Eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis (ECRS) is an inflammatory pathological condition of the nose and paranasal sinuses. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common disease worldwide, and CRS may be divided into ECRS and non-ECRS subtypes based on the presence of tissue eosinophilic infiltration or not. There are significant geographic and ethnic differences in the tissue eosinophilic infiltration, which is predominant in Western white patients and less common in East Asians, despite an increasing tendency for its prevalence in East Asia countries. ECRS commonly demonstrates more severe symptoms, polyp diseases with a higher incidence of bilateral polyps and sinonasal diseases on computed tomography, and the increase in blood eosinophils. Patients with ECRS exhibit clinical characteristics that include long term nasal congestion, mucus production, olfactory disturbances, bilateral nasal polyposis, and intermittent acute exacerbation of secondary bacterial infections. Since there is no approved medication to treat patients with ECRS with nasal polyps completely, surgery is often needed to clear the sinonasal passage, and repeated endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) is often required. The effectiveness of low-dose, long-term erythromycin treatment (macrolide therapy) was reported for the treatment of CRS in Japan.","Immune system disease; Respiratory disease; Skin and connective tissue disease"

"H00015","Malignant pleural mesothelioma","Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a rare but very aggressive tumor that arises from mesothelial cells lining the pleural, peritoneal and pericardial cavities. Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is the most common type, accounting for about 70% of all MM cases. Past asbestos exposure represents the major risk factor for MPM, as the link between asbestos fibres and MPM has been largely proved by epidemiological and experimental studies. Recently, simian virus 40 (SV40) has been implicated in the aetiology of MPM. The accumulation of numerous clonal chromosomal deletions in most MMs suggests a multistep process of tumorigenesis, characterized by the loss and/or inactivation of multiple tumor suppressor genes (TSGs). Cytogenetic and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analyses of MMs have demonstrated frequent deletions of specific sites within chromosome arms 1p, 3p, 6q, 9p, 13q, 15q, and 22q. Furthermore, TSGs within two of these regions, i.e., p16/CDKN2A-p14ARF at 9p21 and NF2 at 22q12, are frequently altered in MMs. Mutations of the p53 gene (TP53) are occasionally observed in MMs.","Cancer"

"H01762","Muscle glycogen storage disease","Glycogen storage diseases (GSD) are inherited metabolic disorders of glycogen metabolism. They are divided into types 0 to XV, according to enzyme or transporter deficiency and organ distribution. Disorders of glycogen degradation may affect primarily the liver, the muscle, or both. GSD has been known to mainly be a liver disease with the exception of Pompe (GSD II), McArdle (GSD V), or Tarui (GSD VII) diseases. Recently, however, various muscular disorders involving different types of muscles have been described to be caused by defective glycogen metabolism. In the Muscle GSDs, the consequence of a block in skeletal muscle glycogenolysis, or in the glycolysis, is an impairment of muscular performance, owing to an increase in glycogen storage that disrupts contractile function and/or a reduced substrate turnover, which inhibits skeletal muscle ATP production.","Inherited metabolic disease; Musculoskeletal disease"

"H01592","Medullary thyroid cancer","Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a malignant tumor originating from thyroid parafollicular C cells and accounts for only <5% of thyroid cancers, but it causes a disproportionate number of thyroid cancer deaths due to its more aggressive clinical behavior compared with well-differentiated papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas. A subset of MTC cases is hereditary and due to germline mutations in the RET tyrosine kinase receptor gene. Somatic mutations in either RET or RAS are also present in most sporadic tumors. In MTC, RET mutations lead to substrate-independent dimerization of the receptor causing constitutive activation, unrestricted signaling, and ultimately, cancer.","Cancer"
"H00024","Prostate cancer","Prostate cancer constitutes a major health problem in Western countries. It is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among men and the second leading cause of male cancer deaths. The identification of key molecular alterations in prostate-cancer cells implicates carcinogen defenses (GSTP1), growth-factor-signaling pathways (NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27), and androgens (AR) as critical determinants of the phenotype of prostate-cancer cells. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTP1) are detoxifying enzymes. Cells of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, devoid of GSTP1, undergo genomic damage mediated by carcinogens. NKX3.1, PTEN, and p27 regulate the growth and survival of prostate cells in the normal prostate. Inadequate levels of PTEN and NKX3.1 lead to a reduction in p27 levels and to increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis. Androgen receptor (AR) is a transcription factor that is normally activated by its androgen ligand. During androgen withdrawal therapy, the AR signal transduction pathway also could be activated by amplification of the AR gene, by AR gene mutations, or by altered activity of AR coactivators. Through these mechanisms, tumor cells lead to the emergence of androgen-independent prostate cancer.","Cancer"

"H01901","Barrett esophagus","Barrett esophagus (BE) is the premalignant lesion of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) defined as specialized intestinal metaplasia (SIM) of the tubular esophagus. According to some studies, the incidence of the esophageal adenocarcinoma in patients with BE is of about 0.5% per year. The major pathogenetic factor in the development of BE is represented by the gastroesophageal reflux disease. BE is characterized by the replacement of the normal squamous epithelium with the columnar epithelium, when the healing of the lesion occurs. Because only a minority of patients (around 10-15%) with gastroesophageal reflux disease have BE, additional factors that play important roles in determining the development of BE must concur. Another frequent association with BE, is represented by nitrate, an increased age, Caucasian race, male sex and hiatal hernia.

"H01561","Chiari malformation","Chiari malformations, also known as Arnold-Chiari syndrome, is a group of syndromes consisting of different kinds of pathologic conditions of the posterior fossa development. They are congenital in most cases, caused by structural defects in the brain spinal cord which may involve genetic mutations or lack of proper vitamins or nutrients in the maternal diet. Less frequently, Chiari malformations are acquired after birth. Causes of acquired Chiari malformations involve injuries, exposure to harmful substances, infections. More rarely, chronic subdural hematoma can be the cause of progressive caudal descent of the cerebellar tonsils. Chiari malformations were classified by Hans Chiari in 1891, into four groups.

"H00243","Hyperkalemic distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA type 4)","Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is characterized by metabolic acidosis, a severe disturbance of extracellular pH homeostasis, due to renal impaired acid excretion. Type 4 RTA is a heterogeneous group of disorders associated with hyperkalemia due to aldosterone deficiency or impairment in aldosterone molecular signaling. Primary pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1) is characterized by salt-wasting, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis in the presence of markedly elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration. In the autosomal dominant form, aldosterone resistance is due to heterozygous mutations in the mineralocorticoid receptor gene. In the autosomal recessive form, aldosterone resistance is caused by loss-of-function homozygous mutations in the genes encoding one of the three constitutive subunits (alpha, beta, and gamma) of the epithelial Na+ channel (SCNN1A, SCNN1B, and SCNN1G). Other inherited cause of type 4 RTA includes hyperkalaemia associated with hypertension and low or normal levels of plasma aldosterone. This syndrome is called pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2 (PHA2), or Gordon's syndrome, which results in a renal aldosterone resistance. Mutations in the genes encoding WNK1 and WNK4 kinases (WNK1 and WNK4), which regulate ion-transportors on renal tubules, were identified in patients with PHA2. Acquired hyperkalemic RTA is observed in the context of mineralocorticoid deficiency, systemic lupus erythematosus, and AIDS nephropathy.

LSs are subclassified into well-differentiated, myxoid, round cell, and pleomorphic types. The myxoid type, the most common subtype, accounts for approximately 40% to 54% of all liposarcomas. The karyotypic hallmark of myxoid LS is the t(12;16)(q13;p11), present cytogenetically in >90% of the cases. The translocation leads to the fusion of the DDIT3(CHOP) and FUS(TLS) genes at 12q13 and 16p11, respectively, and the generation of a FUS-DDIT3 hybrid protein. In 4 cases of myxoid LS, a variant chromosomal translocation has been described, t(12;22), in which DDIT3 fuses instead with EWSR1(EWS), a gene highly related to TLS.","Cancer"

"H01739","Polycystic ovary syndrome","Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common heterogeneous endocrine disorder characterized by elevated androgen levels, menstrual irregularities, and/or small cysts on one or both ovaries. Clinical manifestations include oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, hirsutism, and frequently infertility. Clinical signs of PCOS include elevated luteinizing hormone (LH) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) levels, whereas follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels are muted or unchanged. As a result of the increase in GnRH, stimulation of the ovarian theca cells, in turn, produces more androgens. Risk factors for PCOS in adults includes insulin resistance (IR), type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. PCOS can be described as an oligogenic disorder in which the interaction of a number of genetic and environmental factors determine the heterogeneous, clinical, and biochemical phenotype.

"H01706","Delayed endolymphatic hydrops","Delayed endolymphatic hydrops (DEH) is a disorder, characterized by episodic vertigo that develops some time after the onset of a profound, typically unilateral sensorineural hearing loss. DEH can be differentiated from Meniere's disease. The age of onset of symptoms is typically in later childhood and adolescence or between 40 and 60 years of age. DEH probably is caused by atrophy or fibrous obliteration of the endolymphatic resorptive system of the membranous labyrinth. It has been reported that genetic factors may sometimes be the cause of this disease. Two types of DEH exist: the ipsilateral type, in which the ear with profound hearing loss suffers progressive endolymphatic hydrops, and the contralateral type, in which the formation of progressive endolymphatic hydrops takes place in the ear opposite to the previously deafened ear. DEH requires conservative treatment, such as that typically used for Meniere's disease, including the appropriate concomitant use of diuretics, such as isosorbide or steroids for at least 3-6 months. When recurrent episodic vertigo cannot be remedied through conservative treatment, labyrinthectomy and vestibular neurectomy on the deaf ear are curative for ipsilateral DEH. However, no such surgical treatment is available for the contralateral type.","Nervous system disease"

"H00082","Graves disease","Graves disease is a common form of chronic autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), and is characterized by overstimulation of the thyroid gland with agonistic anti-thyrotropin (TSH) receptor autoantibodies. This overstimulation leads to follicular hypertrophy and hyperplasia, causing thyroid enlargement, as well as increases in thyroid hormone production and the fraction of triiodothyronine (T3) relative to thyroxine (T4) in thyroid secretion. Thyroid autoimmune diseases are regarded as polygenic disorders resulting from the combination of a genetic predisposition in conjunction with an environmental trigger. Two main approaches have been employed to locate susceptibility loci for AITD, namely case control candidate gene studies and genome-wide linkage screens. Case control candidate gene studies have been employed to investigate numerous genes for association with AITD, but to date, only the human leucocyte region (HLA) on chromosome 6p21 and the cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated 4 (CTLA-4) gene on chromosome 2q33 have been consistently shown to be associated with disease.","Immune system disease"
"H00022","Bladder cancer","The urothelium covers the luminal surface of almost the entire urinary tract, extending from the renal pelvis, through the ureter and bladder, to the proximal urethra. The majority of urothelial carcinoma are bladder carcinomas, and urothelial carcinomas of the renal pelvis and ureter account for only approximately 7% of the total. Urothelial tumours arise and evolve through divergent phenotypic pathways. Some tumours progress from urothelial hyperplasia to low-grade non-invasive superficial papillary tumours. More aggressive variants arise either from flat, high-grade carcinoma in situ (CIS) and progress to invasive tumours, or they arise de novo as invasive tumours. Low-grade papillary tumors frequently show a constitutive activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase-Ras pathway, exhibiting activating mutations in the HRAS and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) genes. In contrast, CIS and invasive tumors frequently show alterations in the TP53 and RB genes and pathways. Invasion and metastases are promoted by several factors that alter the tumour microenvironment, including the aberrant expression of E-cadherins (E-cad), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).","Cancer"

"H01594","Myasthenia gravis","Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by a defective transmission of nerve impulses to muscles leading to muscle weakness and fatigability. Some, but not all, muscles are affected and not necessarily symmetrically. Increased weakness with continued muscle activity represents a diagnostic clue for MG, but these clinical features can vary. MG is B-cell mediated, and is associated with antibodies directed against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR), muscle-specific kinase (MUSK), lipoprotein-related protein 4 (LRP4), or agrin in the postsynaptic membrane at the neuromuscular junction. Patients should be classified into subgroups to help with therapeutic decisions and prognosis. Subgroups based on serum antibodies and clinical features include early-onset, late-onset, thymoma, MUSK, LRP4, antibody-negative, and ocular forms of myasthenia gravis. Agrin-associated MG might emerge as a new entity. The prognosis is good with optimum symptomatic, immunosuppressive, and supportive treatment. The evolution of MG is unpredictable, but it is generally characterized by the occurrence of relapses, sometimes subsequent to remissions and a worsening trend. For 85% of MG patients, the maximum severity is reached within less than 3 years.","Immune system disease; Nervous system disease"

"H01593","Osteoporosis","Osteoporosis is a common disease characterised by a generalised reduction in bone mineral density (BMD), microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue and an increased risk of fracture. Since BMD values fall progressively with age, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases with age. It has been estimated that approximately 50% of all women will have osteoporosis by the age of 80. Studies in twins and families indicate that genetic factors play an important role in the regulation of BMD and other determinants of osteoporotic fracture risk. Osteoporosis is a polygenic disorder, determined by the effects of several genes, each with relatively modest effects. Population-based studies and case-control studies have similarly identified polymorphisms in several candidate genes that have been associated with bone mass or osteoporotic fracture, including the vitamin D receptor, oestrogen receptor and collagen gene. Bisphosphonates, and in some patients denosumab, are first-line drugs for osteoporosis.","Musculoskeletal disease"
"H00673","Weill-Marchesani syndrome","Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS) is a rare connective tissue disorder characterized by short stature, brachydactyly, ectopia lentis and spherophakia. Decreased joint flexibility is one of the features of this syndrome.","Congenital malformation"

The mutations in MARS associated with ILLD have been reported.","Respiratory disease"
"H00217","Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis","Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare but potentially treatable disease, characterized by impaired surfactant metabolism that leads to accumulation in the alveoli of proteinaceous material rich in surfactant protein and its component. PAP is classified into 2 main types, congenital and acquired. The acquired form is subdivided into the autoimmune form and the secondary form. The vast majority of PAP occurs as an autoimmune PAP. In autoimmune PAP, patients generate antibodies against the granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) protein. Whole-lung lavage is the most widely accepted therapy for symptomatic PAP. Recent data suggest that exogenous GM-CSF therapy has potential in the treatment of autoimmune PAP. Congenital PAP is also known as pulmonary surfactant metabolism dysfunction (SMDP).","Respiratory disease"

To date, mutations in four genes have been identified as causing STGD, including ABCA4, ELOVL4, PROM1, and CNGB3.","Nervous system disease"
"H00025","Penile cancer","Penile cancer is a disease with a high morbidity and mortality. Its prevalence is relatively rare in developed countries but more common in South America and East Africa. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the predominant tumor type in penile cancer, accounting for 95% of cases. Penile cancers are thought to arise from the progression of precursor lesions and can be subdivided into human papilloma virus (HPV) positive and HPV negative cases. Most common disrupted pathways, both in HPV-mediated and HPV-independent penile carcinogenesis, involve the p14ARF/MDM2/p53 and/or p16INK4a/cyclin D/Rb pathways. HPVs exert their oncogenic effect by expressing the oncoproteins E6 and E7, which bind to and inactivate the p53 and Rb tumor suppressor gene products, respectively. HPV independent mechanisms of pathway inactivation include silencing of the p16INK4a gene by promoter hypermethylation, somatic mutations of the p53 gene, over-expression of MDM2 and mutation of p14ARF. Several other molecular events include alterations in the activity and/or expression of ras and myc genes, cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX) pathway and prostaglandin E2 synthase. These alterations have been described in both HPV-positive and -negative penile cancers.","Cancer"
"H01558","Parathyroid carcinoma","Parathyroid carcinoma (PC) is a highly aggressive endocrine tumor, with an annual incidence of less than 1 per million. Over 90% of patients present with excess parathyroid hormone (PTH), representing <1-5% of all patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. PC is associated with mutations in the HRPT2/CDC73 gene and with decreased parafibromin and calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) expression. Negative parafibromin staining together with a CDC73 gene mutation increases the likelihood of malignancy and also predicts the clinical outcome, namely local invasion and/or metastases and mortality. An increased mortality is predicted by either of these abnormality combined with down regulation of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) expression.","Cancer"

"H00013","Small cell lung cancer","Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among men and women in industrialized countries. Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is a highly aggressive neoplasm, which accounts for approximately 25% of all lung cancer cases. Molecular mechanisms altered in SCLC include induced expression of oncogene, MYC, and loss of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, PTEN, RB, and FHIT. The overexpression of MYC proteins in SCLC is largely a result of gene amplification. Such overexpression leads to more rapid proliferation and loss of terminal differentiation. Mutation or deletion of p53 or PTEN can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The retinoblastoma gene RB1 encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that helps to regulate cell-cycle progression. The fragile histidine triad gene FHIT encodes the enzyme diadenosine triphosphate hydrolase, which is thought to have an indirect role in proapoptosis and cell-cycle control.","Cancer"

"H00014","Non-small cell lung cancer","Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among men and women in industrialized countries. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS, EGFR and EML4-ALK, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Mutations or overexpression of EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. EML4-ALK fusion leads to constitutive ALK activation, which causes cell proliferation, invasion, and inhibition of apoptosis. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC. RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity. RASSF1A is able to form heterodimers with Nore-1, an RAS effector. Therefore loss of RASSF1A might shift the balance of RAS activity towards a growth-promoting effect.","Cancer"

"H01556","Meningioma","Meningiomas are the second-most common central nervous system tumor in adults. These tumors arise from arachnoid cells of the meninges, the covering layer of the brain. The majority of meningiomas tend to be benign, localized, and non-invasive. However, some meningiomas tend to be more aggressive with tendencies toward invasion of the surrounding brain, high propensity for recurrence, and in rare cases extracranial metastasis. Hereditary factors and ionizing radiation play an important role in the initiation of at least some meningiomas. Inactivation of the NF2 tumor suppressor gene is likely responsible for the initiation of more than half of all meningiomas and may cause a mesenchymal-like cytomorphology. Recently, novel mutations have been discovered in non-NF2 meningiomas. The somatic mutations in components of the SHH-GLI1 and AKT1-MTOR signaling pathways indicates the potential for cross talk of these pathways in the development of meningiomas.","Cancer"

LPPS is characterised by multiple popliteal pterygia, cutaneous syndactyly, lack of nails, ankyloblepharon, filiform bands between the jaws, hypoplastic external genitalia, cleft lip and/or palate, and fetal or neonatal lethality, although, in the latter case, survival into childhood and beyond has been reported. It has been shown that recessive mutations in RIPK4 cause LPPS.","Congenital malformation"
"H01720","Southeast Asian ovalocytosis","Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO) is a very common condition in the aboriginal peoples from Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and southern Thailand, in areas where malaria is endemic, with prevalence varying between 5% and 25%. SAO is now known to be caused by a 27 base-pair deletion in SLC4A1, which codes for band 3, a 911 amino acid protein that is both a structural component of the red cell membrane cytoskeleton and the chloride-bicarbonate anion-exchanger in this membrane. SAO is believed to have evolved because these parts of Southeast Asia historically have had a high incidence of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, against which SAO offers clinical protection. Individuals with SAO are characterized as having oval-shaped red blood cells with increased membrane rigidity and decreased anion transport, but no clinical symptoms beyond sporadic associations with anemia in both adults and neonates. The diagnosis is made accidentally as a result of a peripheral blood smear examination, showing the characteristic rounded elliptocytes (ovalocytes).","Hematologic disease"
"H01512","Langerhans cell histiocytosis","Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare histiocytic disorder characterized by a clonal proliferation of specialized cells with characteristics resembling antigen-presenting cells that reside in the skin and mucosa. Its clinical presentation is variable and ranges from isolated skin or bone disease to a life-threatening multisystem condition. Historically, it has been hypothesized that the disease originated from epidermal Langerhans cells. However, new evidence supports a model in which LCH occurs as a consequence of a misguided differentiation programme of myeloid dendritic cell precursors. In LCH, there is a very high frequency of activating mutations in MAPK signaling pathway genes, most notably BRAF-V600E, as well as MAP2K1. Genetic, molecular and functional data implicate activation of the MAPK (ERK) signalling pathway at critical stages in myeloid differentiation as an essential and universal driver of LCH pathology.","Cancer"

Staphylococcus saprophyticus is a coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, gram-positive uropathogen and frequently isolated from young female outpatients presenting with uncomplicated urinary tract infections. S. saprophyticus causes uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) but no severe bacterial infectious disease as caused by S. aureus. The urease of S. saprophyticus is known to be a virulent factor for the persistent infection in the urinary tract. All of the virulence factors of S. aureus, such as coagulase, hemolysins, enterotoxins, extracellular matrixbinding proteins, and exoenzymes, are absent in the S. saprophyticus genome. Besides S. saprophyticus is a leading gram-positive uropathogen of uncomplicated UTI, a restricted group of gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella spp. is often observed to cause uncomplicated UTI.","Infectious disease"
"H00898","Myopathy with lactic acidosis and sideroblastic anaemia","Myopathy with lactic acidosis and sideroblastic anaemia (MLASA) is a rare autosomal recessive oxidative phosphorylation disorder specific to skeletal muscle and bone marrow. MLASA has been associated with a missense mutation in pseudouridylate synthase 1 (PUS1), an enzyme located in both nucleus and mitochondria, which converts uridine into pseudouridine in several cytosolic and mitochondrial tRNA positions and increases the efficiency of protein synthesis in both compartments. Recentry, it has been reported that a mutation of the mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase gene, YARS2, also causes MLASA. Myopathy with succinate dehydrogenase and aconitase deficiency has been found to be caused by mutations in the gene encoding the iron-sulphur cluster scaffold protein (ISCU). ISCU is essential for the activity mitochondrial iron-sulphur proteins such as succinate dehydrogenase and aconitase.","Congenital disorder of metabolism"
"H01344","Nijmegen syndrome","Nijmegen Breakage syndrome (NBS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by microcephaly, growth retardation, immunodeficiency, radiosensitivity, and cancer predisposition. Due to a founder mutation in the NBN gene, the disease is encountered most frequently among Slavic populations. Recently, a disease due to RAD50 deficiency has been reported. The patient displayed symptoms similar to NBS, microcephaly, mental retardation, bird-like face, and short stature. The MRE11/RAD50/NBN (MRN) complex plays a key role in recognizing and signaling DNA double-strand breaks.","Immune system disease"
"H00296","Defects in RecQ helicases","RecQ helicases have crucial roles in the maintenance of genome stability. In humans, it is known that deficiencies in three of the five human RecQ helicases cause genetic disorders characterized by cancer predisposition, premature aging and developmental abnormalities. These disorders are Bloom's syndrome (BS), Werner's syndrome (WS), and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS), which are caused by mutations in BLM, WRN and RECQ4, respectively. Despite the apparent structural and biochemical similarities between the BLM, WRN and RECQ4 proteins, the phenotypes of BS, WS and RTS are different, suggesting that each disease pathway is functionally distinct to some extent. BS is characterized by most prominently, a predisposition to all types of cancers. WS is characterized by the premature development of features that resemble aging. RTS is characterized by skin and skeletal abnormalities, signs of premature aging, and cancer predisposition, especially to osteosarcomas. Recent research has shown many connections between all three proteins and the regulation of excess HR (Homologous recombination). It was also indicated that BLM is involved in repair of stalled DNA replication forks, and that WRN is required for telomere maintenance. Mutations in RECQL4 also associate with 2 additional syndromes, Rapadilino and Baller-Gerold syndrome.","Congenital malformation"

"H00050","Synovial sarcoma","Synovial sarcomas account for 7% to 10% of all human soft-tissue sarcomas. The tumors arise at any age, but affect mainly young adults and more commonly males. Clinically, they appear as deep-seated slowly growing masses. In more than half of the cases, metastases develop, primarily to the lungs but also to the lymph nodes and bone marrow. A specific translocation, t(X; 18)(p11.2; q11.2), is found in more than 90% of reported synovial sarcoma, including biphasic, monophasic, and poorly differentiated tumors. The breakpoints of the t(X; 18) have been cloned and shown to involve the fusion of the SYT gene at 18q11 to either of two highly homologous genes at Xp11 called SSX1 and SSX2. The SYT-SSX1 fusion is associated with biphasic morphology and a worse prognosis, whereas the SYT-SSX2 fusion tends to show monophasic morphology and better outcome.","Cancer"
"H00262","Spina bifida","Spina bifida is among the phenotypes of the larger condition known as neural tube defects (NTDs). It is a group of congenital defects of closure of one or more vertebral arches. NTDs can occur in two major forms: spina bifida aperta, which is the open-lesion NTD, and the closed-lesion NTD, more commonly known as spina bifida occulta. The genetic studies have shown the relationships of folate-related genes. Spina bifida aperta may be referred to as either myeloschisis or myelomeningocele. Myelomeningocele is when the spinal cord protrudes from the spinal canal into a fluid-filled sac resulting from incomplete closure of the primary neural tube. Myeloschisis is when the incomplete closure of the primary neural plate results in a cleft spinal cord with the edges flush with the defect. Myelomeningocele is usually associated with a type II Chiari hindbrain malformation, ventriculomegaly, and hydrocephalus.","Congenital malformation"

"H00057","Parkinson disease","Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder that results primarily from the death of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Both environmental factors and mutations in familial PD-linked genes such as SNCA, Parkin, DJ-1, PINK1 and LRRK2 are associated with PD pathogenesis. These pathogenic mutations and environmental factors are known to cause disease due to oxidative stress, intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis impairment, mitochondrial dysfunctions and altered protein handling compromising key roles of DA neuronal function and survival. The demise of DA neurons located in the SNc leads to a drop in the dopaminergic input to the striatum, which is hypothesized to impede movement by inducing hypo and hyper activity in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) of the direct (dSPNs) and indirect (iSPNs) pathways in the basal ganglia, respectively.","Neurodegenerative disease"

"H01718","Kawasaki disease","Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis of childhood that does not have a known cause or aetiology. KD is a self-limited illness that is not associated with the production of autoantibodies or the deposition of immune complexes, and it rarely recurs. The disease is believed to result from an aberrant inflammatory response to an infectious trigger in a genetically predisposed individual. Classic (typical) Kawasaki disease is diagnosed based on the presence of a fever lasting five or more days, accompanied by four out of five findings: bilateral conjunctival injection, oral changes such as cracked and erythematous lips and strawberry tongue, cervical lymphadenopathy, extremity changes such as erythema or palm and sole desquamation, and polymorphous rash. Incomplete (atypical) Kawasaki disease occurs in persons with fever lasting five or more days and with two or three of these findings. The standard treatment of acute KD is intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion and aspirin. However, 10-20% of patients show resistance to IVIG therapy and present higher risk of coronary vasculitis. If there is no response to treatment, patients are given a second dose of IVIG with or without corticosteroids or other adjunctive treatment.","Cardiovascular disease; Hematologic disease; Skin and connective tissue disease"

"H01381","Antithrombin III deficiency","Inherited Antithrombin (AT) deficiency is an autosomal dominant disorder, that is associated with an increased risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) and pregnancy loss. AT is a potent inactivator of thrombin and factor Xa and the major inhibitor of blood coagulation. This disease is divided into type I deficiency, in which both the functional activity and antigenic levels AT are proportionately reduced, and type II deficiency, in which normal antigen levels are found in association with low AT activity due to a dysfunctional protein. Type II deficiencies can be further subclassified into three types, depending on the location of the mutations. Type IIa is caused by mutations that affect AT's reactive site. Type IIb is characterized by an abnormality of the heparin-binding domain. Type IIc variants are a pleiotropic group of mutations near the reactive loop site.","Hematologic disease"

"H00061","Prion disease","Prion diseases, also termed transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), are a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases that affect humans and a number of other animal species. The etiology of these diseases is thought to be associated with the conversion of a normal protein, PrPC, into an infectious, pathogenic form, PrPSc. The conversion is induced by prion infections (for example, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), iatrogenic CJD, Kuru), mutations (familial CJD, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, fatal familial insomnia (FFI)) or unknown factors (sporadic CJD (sCJD)), and is thought to occur after PrPC has reached the plasma membrane or is re-internalized for degradation. The PrPSc form shows greater protease resistance than PrPC and accumulates in affected individuals, often in the form of extracellular plaques. Pathways that may lead to neuronal death comprise oxidative stress, regulated activation of complement, ubiquitin-proteasome and endosomal-lysosomal systems, synaptic alterations and dendritic atrophy, corticosteroid response, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. In addition, the conformational transition could lead to the lost of a beneficial activity of the natively folded protein, PrPC.","Neurodegenerative disease"

Recent research suggested that the WIPF1-encoded protein WIP binds to the region of WASP which is frequently mutated in patients with this disease, and WIP mutations themselves lead to an immunological disorder resembling Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.","Primary immunodeficiency"
"H01711","Spinal stenosis","Spinal stenosis is an abnormal narrowing of the spinal canal that mainly occurs in the cervical and lumbar regions. Cervical stenosis presents with axial neck pain, radiculopathy, myelopathy, or a combination of these presentations. Axial pain refers to pain that occurs along the spinal column, while radiculopathy refers to complaints in a dermatomal or myotomal distribution often occurring in the arms. Patients may complain of numbness, pain or loss of function. Myelopathy refers to a cluster of complaints and findings due to intrinsic damage to the spinal cord itself. Patients might report numbness, coordination and gait issues, grip weakness and bowel and bladder complaint. Lumbar spinal stenosis is a major cause of pain and functional disability for the elderly. Neurogenic claudication symptoms are a hallmark of lumbar spinal stenosis, where patients develop low back or leg pain when walking or standing that is relieved by sitting or lumbar flexion. The treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis generally begins with conservative management such as physical therapy, home exercise programs, and oral analgesics. Once these therapies fail, patients commonly move forward with interventional pain treatment options such as epidural steroid injections (ESIs), nerve block, or surgery as the next step. Coexisting lumbar and cervical stenosis (tandem spinal stenosis) is an infrequent presentation with mixed presentation of upper motor neuron and lower motor neuron signs. But very few reports of tandem spinal stenosis are available.","Musculoskeletal disease"

G6PD deficiency is the most common enzymatic disorder in humans. It is estimated that about 400 million people are affected by this deficiency. More than 400 biochemical variants of G6PD deficiency have since been defined, and grouped into five classes based on enzyme activity and clinical manifestations. The most common clinical manifestations are neonatal jaundice and acute haemolytic anaemia, which in most patients is triggered by an exogenous agent. A G6PD-deficient patient lacks the ability to protect red blood cells against oxidative stresses from certain drugs, infections, metabolic conditions, and ingestion of fava beans.","Inherited metabolic disease; Hematologic disease"
"H00095","Ectodermal dysplasia associated immunodeficiency","Ectodermal dysplasia (ED) refers to a group of inherited disorders involving absence or dysplasia of the ectodermal appendages. Clinically, it is characterized by absence, abnormality, or deficient function of ectodermal derivatives, including skin, teeth, hair, eccrine glands, or nails. In the hypohidrotic/ anhidrotic form of ED (HED/EDA) the patient has no sweat glands, sparse scalp hair and rare conical teeth. Patients with EDA and immunodeficiency (EDA-ID) present some or all of these features, together with severe infectious diseases. EDA-ID principally affects boys, suggesting X-linked recessive inheritance (XL-EDA-ID). This was confirmed in 2000 and beyond with the identification of disease-causing hypomorphic mutations in NEMO, which is located on the X chromosome and encodes IKK-gamma. A novel autosomal dominant of EDA-ID, recently identified in one child, was found to be caused by a hypermorphic mutation of the gene encoding I{kappa}B{alpha}. Similar to XL-EDA-ID patients, from the age of two months he suffered from multiple and severe infections with several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, leading to chronic bronchopneumonitis and gastroenteritis, with failure to thrive.","Immune system disease"

Among many species of Diptera that cause larval infection in humans, Dermatobia hominis, the human botfly, is responsible for the painful, boil-like lesion of furuncular myiasis.","Infectious disease"
"H00896","Lymphangioleiomyomatosis","Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare lung disease, primarily affecting women. Abnormal proliferation of smooth muscle-like cells (LAM cells) within the lung is responsible for cystic destruction of the lung parenchyma and leads to chronic respiratory failure. Another characteristic feature of the disease is the development of fluid-filled lymphatic cystic structures (lymphangioleiomyomas) in the axial lymphatics and of angiomyolipomas in the kidneys. Its presentation is sporadic or associated with tuberous sclerosis complex, a dominant autosomal neurocutaneous syndrome. Both disorders have their origin in mutations of the tuberous sclerosis genes TSC1 and TSC2, which are involved in the regulation of cell signs critical for energy control and cell nutrition processes.","Cancer; Cardiovascular disease; Immune system disease"

"H00092","T-B-Severe combined immunodeficiency","Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) comprises a heterogeneous group of monogenic disorders that result in early-onset severe infections by a range of pathogens (such as bacteria, viruses and fungi). Typically, patients with SCID have a severe defect in T-cell differentiation, along with direct or indirect impairment of B-cell development and function. Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency accounts for about half of the autosomal recessive forms of SCIDs. It is one of the most severe immunodeficiencies and is associated with severe depletion of B cells, T cells, and NK cells. V(D)J- recombination deficiency caused by defects in recombinase-activating gene 1 (RAG1), RAG2 and Artemis (DCLRE1C) leads to a T-B-SCID phenotype that is characterized by an arrest of B- and T-cell maturation at the stage of pro-B and pre-T cells, respectively, whereas natural killer (NK)-cell maturation is not affected. V(D)J recombination generates the diversity of B- and T-cell primary immune repertoires.","Primary immunodeficiency"

"H01716","Idiopathic interstitial pneumonias","Idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIP) are a heterogeneous subset of interstitial lung diseases, characterized by unknown aetiology. Despite the varied nature of IIPs, the common histological feature is distortion of lung interstitium by highly variable combinations of inflammation and fibrosis. Patients experience common symptoms related to their chronic lung disease. Dyspnoea, cough, fatigue and depression contribute substantially to morbidity and are often difficult to manage. It has been reported that pulmonary rehabilitation plays a central role in symptom management and has beneficial effects. According to the current American thoracic society/European respiratory society (ATS/ERS), IIPs are categorised as major IIPs, rare IIPs and unclassifiable IIPs. There are six major IIPs, namely, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), respiratory bronchiolitis-interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD), desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP), cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP), and acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP). And they are divided into three major groups; chronic fibrosing IIP (IPF, NSIP), smoking-related IIP (RB-ILD, DIP), and acute/ subacute IIP (COP, AIP). The rare IIPs include idiopathic lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP) and idiopathic pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis. IPF accounts for the majority of IIP. It is considered to be lethal because prognosis is very poor and far worse than other types of IIP. An early and accurate diagnosis of IPF is critical.","Lung disease"

Most patients with this syndrome have a genomic deletion of chromosome 22q11, including the DiGeorge critical region (DGCR). A small number of cases of DGS have defects in other chromosomes, notably 10p13. Approximately 17% of patients with the phenotypic features of this syndrome have no detectable genomic deletion. Several mutations in TBX1 have been identified recently in non-deleted patients, including missense and frameshift mutations.","Primary immunodeficiency; Developmental disorder"
"H00630","Rheumatoid arthritis","Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease that primarily manifests as chronic inflammatory arthropathy. Persistent synovitis leads to cartilage destruction, bone erosions and periarticular decalcification, subsequently resulting in impaired joint function. It is more common between the ages of 35 and 50 years, affecting three times more women than men. Susceptibility to RA is genetically determined with multiple genes contributing. Inheritance of HLA DRB1 alleles encoding a distinctive five-amino-acid sequence known as the 'shared epitope' (SE) is the best characterized genetic risk factor. The mechanism by which the SE alleles contribute to the development of RA is not very clear. It has been postulated that the presence of these conserved sequences in the antigen-binding groove alters the way antigenic peptides are bound to and presented to T-cell lymphocytes. This, in turn, may trigger abnormal immune responses and lead to RA.","Autoimmune disease"
"H02167","Lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome","Lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome (LD) is an autosomal dominant disorder, characterized by late childhood or pubertal onset lymphedema of the limbs and double row of eyelashes.

"H01729","Premature ventricular complexes","Premature ventricular complex (PVC) is characterized by the premature occurrence of a QRS complex that is bizarre in shape and lasts longer than 120 msec. The T wave is large and usually of opposite polarity to the QRS complex. A PVC is usually followed by a full compensatory pause. PVCs are commonly encountered in apparently healthy individuals with a reported incidence of approximately 1% on standard 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) and 40% to 75% on routine 24 hour to 48 hour Holter monitoring. The clinical presentation may range from asymptomatic to left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with congestive heart failure. In many patients, ectopic ventricular events manifest as asymptomatic, isolated PVCs that have a benign prognosis in those without structural heart disease. In others, PVCs may be frequent and highly symptomatic, presenting as palpitations, chest discomfort, or presyncope. Clinical evidence suggests that frequent PVCs (variably defined in the literature) are more strongly associated with concomitant cardiac disease. The decision to suppress PVCs is largely based on the presence of symptoms, interference with other therapy (e.g., cardiac resynchronization therapy), or suspicion of PVC-mediated cardiomyopathy. When necessary, treatment for PVCs involves beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or other antiarrhythmic drugs and catheter ablation in selected cases. Catheter ablation of frequent PVCs has been demonstrated to be effective at PVC suppression and is associated with improvement or normalization of ventricular function.","Cardiovascular disease"

It is characterized by exercise intolerance, muscle cramping, and myoglobinuria.","Inherited metabolic disease"
"H00059","Huntington disease","Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects medium spiny striatal neurons (MSN). The symptoms are choreiform, involuntary movements, personality changes and dementia. HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the IT15 gene, which results in a long stretch of polyglutamine (polyQ) close to the amino-terminus of the HD protein huntingtin (Htt). Mutant Htt (mHtt) has effects both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. Full-length Htt is cleaved by proteases in the cytoplasm, leading to the formation of cytoplasmic and neuritic aggregates. mHtt also alters vesicular transport and recycling, causes cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+  overload, triggers endoplasmic reticulum stress through proteasomal dysfunction, and impairs autophagy function, increasing neuronal death susceptibility. N-terminal fragments containing the polyQ strech translocate to the nucleus where they impair transcription and induce neuronal death.","Neurodegenerative disease"

It is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder, although autosomal recessive inheritance also occurs. Paired box gene 6 (PAX6), a member of the paired box family of transcription factors, has been identified as a key regulator of eye development. Currently around 500 mutations of PAX6 have been reported. And most PAX6 nonsense mutations lead to aniridia, while missense mutations are related to foveal hypoplasia, congenital cataracts, or anterior segment anomalies. Recently, it has been reported that mutation of SALL2 causes recessive ocular coloboma.","Congenital malformation"
"H01570","Autosomal dominant striatal degeneration","Autosomal-dominant striatal degeneration (ADSD) is a rare autosomal-dominant movement disorder affecting the striatal part of the basal ganglia, with onset in the fourth to fifth decade. The main clinical features are mild, slowly progressive dysarthria and hypokinesia without any apparent reduction in life expectancy.

"H01584","IgA vasculitis","IgA vasculitis (IgAV), also known as Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP), is the most common systemic small vessel vasculitis in childhood with clinical characteristics of non-thrombocytopenic palpable purpura, arthritis, and involvement of internal organs such as gastrointestine (GI) and kidney. IgAV has been associated with a history of preceding infections, especially upper respiratory tract infection. In addition, other characteristics of IgAV include the deposition of IgA and C3 in small vessel walls, polymorphonuclear neutrophil infiltration around the vessel and in vessel walls, and increased serum levels of IgA and proinflammatory cytokines at the acute stage. Combined, IgAV is regarded as a specific immune-mediated entity induced by environmental factors, particularly infections. Clinically, since there are no disease-specific laboratory abnormalities, IgAV is currently diagnosed based on symptoms and signs and histopathological findings. Treatment is supportive because IgAV is usually self-limiting except for serious GI or renal involvement.","Cardiovascular disease"

It can present as a single nodule, as multifocal unilateral lesions or as bilateral tumours. Typically, nephroblastoma comprises three histological components namely blastemal, epithelial and stromal. WT1, a zinc-finger transcription factor, was identified as the first nephroblastoma gene. Several other genes including CTNNB1, WTX, and TP53 have also been implicated in various stages of tumorigenesis of nephroblastoma.","Cancer"
"H02133","Vici syndrome","Vici syndrome is a rare relentlessly progressive congenital multisystem disorder characterised by five principal features of callosal agenesis, cataracts, cardiomyopathy, combined immunodeficiency, and oculocutaneous hypopigmentation. Profound developmental delay, progressive failure to thrive, and acquired microcephaly are almost universal, suggesting an evolving (neuro) degenerative component. In most patients there is additional variable multisystem involvement that may affect virtually any organ system, including lungs, thyroid, liver, and kidneys. A skeletal myopathy is consistently associated. Recent studies identified mutations in the gene EPG5 as the cause of Vici syndrome. EPG5 is involved in autophagy, an evolutionarily conserved lysosomal degradation process that is essential for cell homeostasis.","Immune system disease"
"H00664","Anemia due to disorders of glycolytic enzymes","Anemia due to disorders of glycolytic enzymes is a group of red cell disorders caused by inherited abnormality of glycolytic enzymes.

"H00032","Thyroid cancer","Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy and accounts for the majority of endocrine cancer- related deaths each year. More than 95% of thyroid carcinomas are derived from follicular cells. Their behavior varies from the indolent growing, well-differentiated papillary and follicular carcinomas (PTC and FTC, respectively) to the extremely aggressive undifferentiated carcinoma (UC). Somatic rearrangements of RET and TRK are almost exclusively found in PTC and may be found in early stages. The most distinctive molecular features of FTC are the prominence of aneuploidy and the high prevalence of RAS mutations and PAX8-PPAR{gamma} rearrangements. p53 seems to play a crucial role in the dedifferentiation process of thyroid carcinoma.","Cancer"

"H00836","GLUT1 deficiency syndrome","GLUT1 deficiency syndrome (GLUT1DS) is an autosomal dominant or recessive inborn error of glucose transport across the blood-brain barrier. The majority of patients carry mutations in the SLC2A1 gene encoding the GLUT1 transporter. Defects in the GLUT1 result in low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose levels termed hypoglycorrhachia. Affected individuals present with mental retardation and learning disabilities; also common are ataxia, dystonia, seizures, and acquired microcephaly.","Nervous system disease"
"H01910","Infantile myofibromatosis","Infantile myofibromatosis (IM) is a benign fibrous tumour of infancy. The most common mode of presentation is with multiple subcutaneous swellings. Most IM lesions occur in neonates or infants under 24 months of age, with few reports of adult onset. It can occur in three forms: solitary, multicentric or generalised. The solitary form is the commonest and occurs as a single cutaneous nodule. The multicentric form involves the skin, subcutaneous tissues, muscles, and bone. The course is generally benign, with no metastases and regression of the tumor over a period of 12 to 18 months. The generalized form is associated with visceral involvement. This condition has serious prognostic implications as there is a 76% mortality from cardiopulmonary or gastrointestinal complications. While most cases of IM appear to be sporadic, there have been several reports of autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Mutations in the PDGFRB and NOTCH3 genes were recently identified in patients with IM. Treatment options vary widely. Solitary and even multicentric lesions that are confined to the skin and subcutaneous tissues without visceral involvement frequently regress spontaneously. However, calcification and atrophic scars can remain after lesion regression. Extensive surgery has been reported to be beneficial for multicentric disease, as has chemotherapy.","Skin and connective tissue disease; Cancer"

In addition, de novo LGI1 mutations are found in about 2% of sporadic cases with idiopathic partial epilepsy with auditory features, who are clinically similar to the majority of patients with ADLTE/ADPEAF but have no family history.","Nervous system disease"
"H00035","Ewing sarcoma","Ewing sarcoma is the second most common malignant bone tumor occurring in children and young adults, and accounts for 10-15% of all primary bone tumors. The annual incidence is approximately 0.6/million total population, and it usually occurs between the ages of 10 and 20 years. Ewing's sarcoma is in 85% of cases associated with the translocation t(11;22)(q24;q12), which leads to the formation of the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion gene. In another 10-15% of cases the translocation t(21;12)(22;12) generates the EWSR1-ERG fusion, whereas the remaining 1-5% of cases may harbor one of several possible translocations, each resulting in a fusion gene containing a portion of the EWSR1 gene and a member of the ETS family of transcription factors.","Cancer"
"H00207","Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata","Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (RCDP) is a lethal autosomal recessive disease associated with impaired peroxisomes characterized by proximal limb shortening, severely disturbed endochondrial bone formation, and mental retardation. RCDP1 is peroxisome biogenesis disorder caused by mutation of peroxisomal biogenesis factor 7(PEX7) genes. RCDP2 and RCDP3 are single peroxisomal enzyme deficiencies caused by mutation of GNPAT and AGPS. Both of them are key enzymes in the biosynthesis of ether phospholipids localized in peroxisomes.","Congenital disorder of metabolism; Congenital malformation"

Manifestations include a tight, thin, translucent skin, typical face, multiple joint contractures, enlarged fontanelles, and dysplasia of clavicles.","Congenital malformation"
"H01583","Hydroxykynureninuria","Hydroxykynureninuria, also known as xanthurenic aciduria is autosomal recessive disorder of tryptophan metabolism. It is characterized by excessive output of xanthutrenic acid, 3-hydroxykynurenine, and kynurenine in urine. This disease is caused by homozygous mutation in the KYNU gene, which encodes kynureninase. Kynureninase is an enzyme in the catabolic pathway of tryptophan metabolism. Some of these deficiencies lead to pellagra or mild pellagra-like symptoms, while it was reported in some patients no symptom of niacin deficiency was observed. The different clinical outcomes could be explained by differences in the intake of niacin. The sufficient intake of niacin could prevent depletion in some patients despite their impaired niacin synthesis.","Inherited metabolic disease"

ET is typically characterized by rhythmic, involuntary shaking of one or more parts of the body, and occurs exclusively during voluntary movements (action tremor) or in positions against gravity (postural tremor). The phenotypic severity of ET is variable, as evidenced by the existence of both highly disabling and milder forms of the disease. There are three subtypes of ET, namely hereditary, sporadic, and senile, and most studies indicate that ET is a hereditary disorder in more than half of affected individuals (and presumably has autosomal-dominant inheritance). The diagnostic approach includes obtaining a history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. At present, there are no validated serologic, radiologic, or pathological markers.","Nervous system disease"

"H01321","Pneumococcal disease","Pneumococcal disease (PD) is infectious disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). PD is particularly common in younger children and in older adults and is roughly divided into invasive and non-invasive disease; the former refers to infections in which the microorganism is isolated from normal sterile body sites, such as the blood or the cerebrospinal fluid. Non-invasive PD can principally be divided into sinusitis, acute otitis media, and community-acquired pneumonia. S. pneumoniae remains the most common bacterial cause of community-acquired pneumonia. The invasive PD burden is mainly determined by pneumococcal meningitis, bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia, and pneumococcal bacteremia without a primary focus. Incidence and mortality rates of both non-invasive and invasive disease have changed as a result of pneumococcal vaccination in children. However, especially elderly patients with comorbidities remain vulnerable to morbidity and mortality caused by PD.","Infectious disease"
"H00800","Loeys-Dietz syndrome","Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by arterial aneurysms and dissections, pectus excavatum, craniosynostosis, cleft palate, congenital heart disease, and thin, translucent skin.

Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, occurring in immunocompromised patients, reflects the most serious disease with a high case-fatality rate. Of the 185 recognized species of Aspergillus, 20 are known to cause infections in humans. Aspergillus fumigatus accounts for about 65 percent of all invasive infections in humans and is the mostly encountered species in pulmonary infections. Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus terreus and Aspergillus nidulans are less frequently causes of invasive and pulmonary infections.","Infectious disease"
"H01926","Ventricular septal defect","Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is the most common type of cardiovascular developmental anomaly and is an important risk factor for the substantially increased morbidity and mortality in newborns. Congenital heart disease (CHD) is divided into more than 30 subtypes based on the cardiac or vascular abnormalities, of which VSD, atrial septal defect (ASD) [DS:H00546], tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) [DS:H00549], and Holt-Oram syndrome (HOS) [DS:H00433] are clinically the most common. VSDs can exist in isolation, can be complicated by additional intracardiac lesions, or can be part of more complex combinations, such as TOF, double outlet right ventricle [DS:H00918], or functionally univentricular hearts [DS:H01787]. Congenital VSDs arise from perturbations of cardiac development during embryogenesis and both environmental and genetic risk factors have been implicated in VSDs. Growing evidence highlights the key role of several transcription factors, including GATA4, in septogenesis.","Cardiovascular disease"
"H00655","McLeod syndrome","McLeod syndrome is an X-linked multisystem disorder including the CNS (chorea, epilepsy), the PNS (axonal polyneuropathy), and the blood cells (acanthocytosis of the erythrocytes) characterized by late onset abnormalities in the neuromuscular and hematopoietic systems. Mild myopathy is a common manifestation in most cases. Patients often present with mild, asymptomatic hyperCKemia. The absence of the XK membrane transport protein seems to be causative.","Nervous system disease"
"H01787","Univentricular heart","Univentricular heart is a term used to describe a wide variety of structural cardiac abnormalities associated with a functional single ventricular chamber. Truly solitary ventricles are exceedingly rare. It is generally agreed that the atrioventricular connection is central in defining the univentricular heart. More specifically, the well-developed ventricle may be designated left, right, or indeterminate. Clinical manifestations hinge on the presence or absence of pulmonary outflow obstruction. Without pulmonary stenosis, infants with low pulmonary resistance present with signs and symptoms typical of large left-to-right shunting, ie, congestive heart failure and failure-to-thrive. A certain degree of pulmonary stenosis is physiologically desirable to prevent pulmonary overcirculation. However, severe pulmonary stenosis or atresia may result in profound hypoxemia and cyanosis.","Developmental disorder; Cardiovascular disease"

"H00003","Acute myeloid leukemia","Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a disease that is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of clonal neoplastic cells and accumulation in the bone marrow of blasts with an impaired differentiation program. AML accounts for approximately 80% of all adult leukemias and remains the most common cause of leukemia death. Two major types of genetic events have been described that are crucial for leukemic transformation. A proposed necessary first event is disordered cell growth and upregulation of cell survival genes. The most common of these activating events were observed in the RTK Flt3, in N-Ras and K-Ras, in Kit, and sporadically in other RTKs. Alterations in myeloid transcription factors governing hematopoietic differentiation provide second necessary event for leukemogenesis. Transcription factor fusion proteins such as PML-RARalpha (in Acute promyelocytic leukemia, a subtype of AML), AML-ETO or PLZF-RARalpha block myeloid cell differentiation by repressing target genes. In other cases, the transcription factors themselves are mutated.","Cancer"
"H00231","Hereditary elliptocytosis","Hereditary elliptocytosis (HE) is an autosomal dominant hematologic disorder characterized by elliptically shaped erythrocytes and a variable degree of hemolytic anemia caused by fragility of the erythrocyte membrane skeleton due to defects in alpha-spectrin, beta-spectrin, or protein 4.1.","Hematologic disease"
"H01919","Proud syndrome","Proud syndrome is a syndromic X-linked mental retardation, characterized by agenesis of the corpus callosum, and abnormal genitalia. ARX is considered to have an important role in neuronal proliferation, interneuronal migration and differentiation in the embryonic brain, and also in the differentiation of the testis. Phenotypes associated with ARX mutations include both brain malformation and non-malformation syndromes. Premature termination mutations and missense mutations in the homeobox domain cause malformation syndromes such as Proud syndrome.","Congenital malformation"
"H01125","Hereditary pyropoikilocytosis","Hereditary pyropoikilocytosis (HPP) is a recessively inherited form of hemolytic anemia characterized by peripheral blood morphology presenting with striking anisopoikilocytosis with red cell fragmentation and microspherocytes. Erythrocytes from most HPP patients exhibit qualitative and quantitative abnormalities of the erythrocyte membrane protein spectrin, the principal structural component of the erythrocyte membrane skeleton. Qualitative spectrin defects are typically associated with missense mutations that lead to abnormal spectrin self-association, a process critical for membrane structure and function.","Hematologic disease"
"H01317","Aggressive periodontitis","Aggressive periodontitis is a disease of the periodontium occurring in an otherwise healthy adolescent, which is characterized by a rapid loss of alveolar bone around more than one tooth of the permanent dentition. Because it tends to have a familial aggregation, host predisposition seems to play a key role in the pathogenesis of aggressive periodontitis. It occurs in localized and generalized forms.","Infectious disease"
"H01773","4p deletion syndrome","4p deletion syndrome, also known as Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS), is a congenital disorder associated with various deformities. WHS is caused by deletion of the WHS critical resion (WHSCR) of chromosome 4p16.3. Because WHS is a contiguous gene deletion syndrome, loss of one copy of a single gene or the synergistic effects of loss of two or more genes could give rise to the features of WHS. The 'Greek warrior helmet appearance' is the most characteristic feature and refers to the facial view with prominent glabella, high arched eyebrow, broad nasal bridge and hypertelorism. Developmental delay and intellectual disability of variable degree is present in all. Seizures occur in 90% to 100% of children. Other findings include skeletal anomalies, congenital heart defects, hearing loss, urinary tract malformations, and structural brain abnormalities. Incidence is estimated to be about 1:50.000 births with a 2:1 female: male ratio.","Chromosomal abnormality"

MICPCH syndrome is caused by inactivating calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (CASK) gene mutations. CASK is a multi-domain scaffolding protein that interacts with the transcription factor TBR1 and regulates expression of genes involved in cortical development such as RELN.","Congenital malformation"
"H00699","Central core disease","Central core disease (CCD) is an inherited neuromuscular disorder characterized by central cores on muscle biopsy and clinical features of a congenital myopathy. CCD is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant trait but recessive inheritance has been recently described in few families. The clinical phenotype of dominantly inherited CCD is variable but usually mild and non-progressive; however, more severe forms including the fetal akinesia syndrome have also been reported associated with recessive or de novo dominant mutations. CCD typically presents in infancy with hypotonia and motor developmental delay and is characterized by predominantly proximal weakness pronounced in the hip girdle. CCD is due to mutations in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYR1) gene, encoding the principal skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release channel (RyR1). Altered excitability and/or changes in calcium homeostasis within muscle cells due to mutation-induced conformational changes of the RyR protein are considered the main pathogenetic mechanisms.","Nervous system disease; Musculoskeletal disease"
"H01579","Congenital symmetric circumferential skin creases","Congenital symmetric circumferential skin creases, also known as Michelin tire baby syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by generalized folding of excess skin. This feature was first described in 1969, then subsequent reports described variable additional features, such as intellectual disability (ID), facial dysmorphism, and cardiac and genital anomalies. It has been reported that mutations in either MAPRE2 or TUBB underlie the genetic origin of this syndrome. MAPRE2 encodes a member of the microtubule end-binding family of proteins that bind to the guanosine triphosphate cap at growing microtubule plus ends, and TUBB encodes a beta-tubulin isotype that is expressed abundantly in the developing brain.","Congenital malformation"
"H02308","Immunodeficiency-centromeric instability-facial anomalies syndrome","Immunodeficiency, centromeric instability and facial dysmorphism (ICF syndrome) is a genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder. It is characterized by recurrent and often fatal respiratory and gastrointestinal infections as a consequence of hypogammaglobulinemia in the presence of B cells. Nearly all patients also present with distinct facial anomalies. Centromeric instability is the cytogenetic hallmark of ICF syndrome. Mutations in the DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) gene account for about 50% of ICF cases, while about 30% of cases have mutations in the ZBTB24 gene. Recently, it has been reported that mutations in CDCA7 and HELLS cause ICF syndrome.","Immune system disease"
"H00807","Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy","Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ENFL) is characterized by nocturnal, frequent, brief and stereotypic seizures. Ictal video electroencephalographic (EEG) studies have revealed partial seizures originating from the frontal lobe but also in parts of the insula, suggesting a defect of a broader network.

"H01774","Hyperostosis corticalis generalisata","Hyperostosis corticalis generalisata, also known as Van Buchem disease (VBCH), is autosomal recessive disease. This disease is characterized by progressive bone overgrowth, with narrowing of the neuroforamina in the skull causing cranial neuropathies. VBD is due to a homozygous deletion of a 52-kb regulatory element 35 kb downstream of the SOST gene, which leads to impaired production of sclerostin. Sclerostin, the gene product of SOST, is an inhibitor of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. VBCH phenotype can be caused by mutation in the LRP5 gene.","Musculoskeletal disease"
"H01310","Multi-minicore disease","Multi-minicore Disease (MmD) is a recessively inherited neuromuscular disorder characterized by multiple cores on muscle biopsy and clinical features of a congenital myopathy. It is morphologically defined by localized multiple areas of mitochondrial depletion and sarcomere disorganization, running to a limited extent along the longitudinal axis of muscle fiber ('minicores'). Marked clinical variability corresponds to genetic heterogeneity. Mutations in the SEPN1 gene have been identified in patients with the classic axial phenotype characterized by spinal rigidity, early scoliosis, and respiratory impairment, whereas mutations in the RYR1 gene have been associated with a wider range of clinical features comprising external ophthalmoplegia, distal weakness and wasting or predominant hip girdle involvement.","Nervous system disease; Musculoskeletal disease"
"H01122","Congenital pulmonary alveolar proteinosis","Congenital pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is also known as pulmonary surfactant metabolism dysfunction (SMDP). It is caused by one of the three different genes associated with surfactant metabolism in type II epithelial cells and characterized by respiratory distress after birth. Congenital PAP is also associated with mutations in CSF2RA and CSF2RB genes, encoding alpha and beta chains of the GM-CSF receptor.","Respiratory disease"
"H00236","Congenital polycythemia","Familial and congenital polycythemia/erythrocytosis includes a heterogeneous group of disorders with the common characteristic of an absolute increased red cell mass caused by inherited defects in hypoxia sensing. In primary polycythemias there is an innate defect in the hematopoietic progenitors which allows constitutive overproduction whereas in secondary polycythemias normal progenitors are acted on by serum erythropoietin.","Hematologic disease"

Several clinical phenotypes for familial CFEOM have been delineated.","Nervous system disease"
"H00004","Chronic myeloid leukemia","Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder of a pluripotent stem cell. The natural history of CML has a triphasic clinical course comprising of an initial chronic phase (CP), which is characterized by expansion of functionally normal myeloid cells, followed by an accelerated phase (AP) and finally a more aggressive blast phase (BP), with loss of terminal differentiation capacity. On the cellular level, CML is associated with a specific chromosome abnormality, the t(9; 22) reciprocal translocation that forms the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. The Ph chromosome is the result of a molecular rearrangement between the c-ABL proto-oncogene on chromosome 9 and the BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene on chromosome 22. The BCR/ABL fusion gene encodes p210 BCR/ABL, an oncoprotein, which, unlike the normal p145 c-Abl, has constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. While fusion of c-ABL and BCR is believed to be the primary cause of the chronic phase of CML, progression to blast crisis requires other molecular changes. Common secondary abnormalities include mutations in TP53, RB, and p16/INK4A, or overexpression of genes such as EVI1. Additional chromosome translocations are also observed,such as t(3;21)(q26;q22), which generates AML1-EVI1.","Cancer"

"H01780","Non-dystrophic myotonia","Non-dystrophic myotonias are rare diseases caused by mutations in key skeletal muscle ion channels. The major clinical manifestation is muscle stiffness as a consequence of the myotonia. Additional common symptoms include pain, weakness and fatigue. They are considered to be distinct from myotonic dystrophy because of the absence of progressive weakness and systemic features. Non-dystrophic myotonias include myotonia congenita, paramyotonia congenita, and sodium channel myotonias.","Nervous system disease; Musculoskeletal disease"
"H02105","Prohormone convertase 1/3 deficiency","Proprotein convertase 1/3 (PC1/3) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the PCSK1 gene.

Orf virus is transmitted to humans by direct or indirect contact with sheep and goats. Its viability on the ground and the ability to reinfect the host has contributed to the spread and maintenance of the infection in many species.","Infectious disease"
"H00403","Disorders of nucleotide excision repair","Mutations in genes on the nucleotide excision repair pathway are associated with diseases, such as xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne syndrome (CS) and trichothiodystrophy (TTD). XP is caused by mutations in XPA, ERCC3/XPB, XPC, ERCC2/XPD, DDB2/XPE, ERCC4/XPF, ERCC5/XPG and POLH. XP is classified into eight genetic complementation groups by the present. In this inside, 7groups from the XP-A group to the G group show the abnormality in NER. The symptoms of XP begin in early life. Severe sunburn and blistering occurs in a half of patients, and all show early extensive freckling. Cancer incidence for individuals with XP under 20 years of age is 2,000 times as high as incidence in the general population. Neurodegeneration can be correlated with mutations in specific XP genes (XPA, ERCC3, ERCC2 and ERCC5). Some patients of XP- A develop neurologic symptoms or a more severe clinical phenotype known as de Sanctis-Cacchione syndrome, associated with mutations in the ERCC6 gene. CS is caused by mutations in ERCC8/CSA, ERCC6/CSB. CS is predominantly a developmental and neurological disorder. It results in a severely reduced lifespan but is not linked to an increased incidence of cancer. The three of the XP genes (ERCC2, ERCC3, and ERCC5) are also found to be mutated XP/CS patients (exhibiting both XP and Cockayne's symptoms). ERCC6 is a cause of UV-sensitive syndrome (UVS) which is characterized by photosensitivity and mild freckling but without neurological abnormalities or skin tumors. TTD is a premature aging syndrome, with the hallmark feature of brittle hair and nails, ichthyosis, and progressive mental and physical retardation. Within photo-sensitive TTD, three TFIIH coding genes (ERCC2, ERCC3, and TTDA/GTF2H5) are implicated. Cerebro-oculo-facio-skeletal (COFS) syndrome is rare autosomal recessive disorder with microcephaly, severe mental retardation, and death in childhood. COFS can result from mutations in ERCC1, ERCC2, ERCC5 and ERCC6.","Congenital malformation"

"H00255","Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism","Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) or secondary hypogonadism is defined as a clinical syndrome that results from gonadal failure due to abnormal pituitary gonadotropin levels. HH may result from either absent or inadequate hypothalamic gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion or failure of pituitary gonadotropin secretion. HH can be congenital or acquired. Congenital HH is clinically and genetically heterogeneous. Clinically, the disorder is characterized by an absence of puberty and infertility. The genetic condition is classically divided in 2 groups based on the presence or absence of olfaction dysfunction. Around 50-60% of the affected individuals exhibit anosmia or hyposmia in association with IHH, defining Kallmann syndrome. Acquired HH can be caused by drugs, infiltrative or infectious pituitary lesions, hyperprolactinemia, encephalic trauma, pituitary/brain radiation, exhausting exercise, abusive alcohol or illicit drug intake, and systemic diseases such as hemochromatosis, sarcoidosis and histiocytosis X.","Endocrine disease"

"H00093","Combined immunodeficiency","The term combined immunodeficiency (CID) is used to distinguish patients with low, but not absent, T-cell function from those with severe CID (SCID) characterized by profound deficiencies of T- and B-cell (and sometimes NK- cell) function. Hyper-IgM syndrome (HIM) represents a group of distinct entities characterized by defective normal or elevated IgM in the presence of diminished IgG and IgA levels. The genetic anomaly in X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome has been mapped to Xq26, and resides in mutations of the CD40 ligand gene. Missense mutation in exon 7 of the common gamma chain (IL2RG) causes a moderate form of X-linked CID. This point mutation in IL2RG leads to a less severe degree of deficiency in cellular and humoral immunity than that seen in XSCID. Two related deficiencies of recombination activating genes, RAG1 and RAG2 result in a spectrum of SCID called RAG1/RAG2 deficiency and Omenn syndrome. Mutations that lead to total absence of RAG1 or RAG2 gene product (null mutations) are known to lead to SCID without mature lymphoid cells, whereas mutations that result in partial V(D)J recombinase activity due to missense mutation on at least one allele lead to Omenn syndrome. Mutations of both TAP1 and TAP2 genes result in deficient expression of class I HLA proteins on the cell surface with defects in natural killer cell cytotoxicity. Defective expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules account for 5% of SCID. The genetic lesions responsible for this syndrome do not lie within the MHC-II locus itself, but reside instead in genes encoding transcription factors, RFX5, RFXAP, RFXANK(B), and CIITA, controlling MHC-II expression. ZAP-70 deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Recurrent and opportunistic infections occur within the first year of life. The mutations in genes responsible for CRAC channel function, ORAI1 and STIM1, cause the defect in Ca2+ influx.","Primary immunodeficiency"

"H01525","22q11.2 deletion syndrome","The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is the most common microdeletion disorder with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 3000-6000 live births. Most of the patients show the common 3 Mb deletion, but proximal 1.5 Mb deletion and unusual deletions located outside the common deleted region, have been detected. Various syndromes have been associated with 22q11.2 deletion including DiGeorge syndrome (DGS), velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS), conotruncal anomaly face syndrome (CTAF), and isolated and familial forms of cardiovascular malformation. Microdeletions of 22q11.2 have been found in more than 90% of patients with DGS and over 85% of VCFS/ CTAF patients. In addition, several patients with Opitz-GBBB syndrome have been reported with microdeletions of 22q11. The variability in the clinical expression of this disease is extremely wide. Classical features include congenital heart disease, velopharyngeal insufficiency or cleft palate, facial anomalies, speech and learning disabilities, neonatal hypocalcemia, and T-cell immune deficit. Nevertheless, the spectrum of anomalies associated with 22q11.2 deletion is becoming wider and wider. Some cardiovascular abnormalities are relatively specific for the syndrome. An interruption of the aortic arch, type-B (IAA-B) is associated with deletion 22q11 in approximately 50% of cases. Other defects including tetralogy of Fallot [DS:H00549], double outflow right ventricle, ventricular septal defect and an aberrant origin of the right subclavian artery are frequently found.","Chromosomal abnormality"
"H01717","Optic neuritis","Optic neuritis is a demyelinating inflammatory disease of the optic nerve that presents with an abrupt loss of vision. The majority of patients are between the ages of 20 and 50 years, with a mean age ranging from 30 to 35 years. It occurs more commonly in women than in men. The onset is usually with pain on eye movement in one eye and subacute visual loss. One-third of patients have a mildly edematous optic disc. The visual disturbance resolves in 95% of cases. Many cases of optic neuritis are associated with multiple sclerosis or neuromyelitis optica or can occur in isolation. Occasionally, optic neuritis can result from infectious processes involving the paranasal sinuses or occur in the course of a systemic viral infection. High-dosed intravenous methylprednisolone therapy speeds recovery but does not improve the final outcome. For patients judged to be at high risk of developing multiple sclerosis, immune prophylaxis with beta-interferon or glatiramer acetate is recommended.","Nervous system disease"
"H02192","Benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis","Benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC) is a rare autosomal recessive inherited disorder characterized by intermittent episodes of severe cholestatic jaundice. It is caused by mutations in the ATP8B1 and ABCB11 genes, which are the same as in progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis 1 and 2 (PFIC1 and PFIC2), and probably in at least one other as yet unidentified gene. While PFIC starts in infancy or early childhood and often leads to liver cirrhosis, BRIC typically appears before the second decade of life and has a more benign recurrent pattern. Occasionally BRIC will progress to the more severe and permanent form of PFIC.","Digestive system disease"

In 90% of patients, ALS is sporadic, with no clear genetic linkage. On the other hand, the remaining 10% of cases show familial inheritance, with mutations in SOD1, TDP43(TARDBP), FUS, or C9orf72 genes being the most frequent causes. In spite of such difference, familial ALS and sporadic ALS have similarities in their pathological features. Proposed disease mechanisms contributing to motor neuron degeneration in ALS are: impaired proteostasis, aberrant RNA processing, mitochondrial disfunction and oxidative stress, microglia activation, and axonal dysfunction.","Neurodegenerative disease"
"H02159","Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome","Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS), also known as familial cold urticaria, is an autosomal dominant inflammatory disease that is characterized by episodes of rash, arthralgia, fever, conjunctivitis, and leukocytosis after generalized exposure to cold.","Immune system disease"

It affects predominantly male babies and is accompanied by severe oligohydramnios, polycystic kidney, bilateral renal agenesis, and obstructive uropathy during middle gestational weeks. Renal failure is the main defect in Potter syndrome. Other characteristic features include premature birth, breech presentation, atypical facial appearance, and limb malformations. Severe respiratory insufficiency leads to a fatal outcome in most infants. Potter syndrome has been divided into 4 distinct subgroups. Potter syndrome type I is referred to as autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), type II as renal dysplasia, type III as autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), and type IV occurs when a longstanding obstruction in either the kidney or ureter leads to cystic kidneys or hydronephrosis. Particularly types II-IV can be part of many syndromes.","Congenital malformation"

The most common clinical manifestations of this disease are Raynaud's phenomenon, arthralgias, swollen joints, esophageal dysfunction, muscle weakness and fingers sausage-like appearance. The disease can be serious with development of pulmonary, kidney, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and central nervous system manifestations. The worst prognosis and high mortality are associated with the presence of pulmonary disease. Therapy should be individualised for each patient to address the specific organs involved and the severity of underlying disease activity. Inflammatory manifestations usually respond to steroid treatment, whereas clinical sclerodermatous manifestations such as sclerodactyly, and pulmonary interstitial disease more often require cytotoxic immunosuppressive treatment.","Immune system disease"
"H02195","MEHMO syndrome","MEHMO syndrome is a rare X-linked syndrome characterised by mental retardation, epileptic seizures, hypogenitalism, microcephaly and obesity.

"H01522","Zollinger-Ellison syndrome","Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) is a rare endocrinopathy caused by tumors of the pancreas and duodenum. These tumors, called gastrinomas, release gastrin to produce large amounts of acid that result in severe gastroesophageal peptic ulcer disease and diarrhea. Most ZES cases are sporadic, but about over 20 percent are caused by an inherited genetic disorder called multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (see H00247). The clinical presentation is not specific for this disease and there is overlap of symptoms similar to those of a peptic ulcer. The most common symptoms include abdominal pain and diarrhea, sometimes accompanied by heartburn, nausea, and weight loss. Peptic ulceration complicated by bleeding is present in 25% of patients, and is more frequently in patients with sporadic ZES than in those with MEN1. In addition, the gastrinomas may be cancerous.

"H00094","Immunodeficiency associated with DNA repair defects","A number of genetically determined disorders collectively called as the chromosome breakage syndromes or DNA-repair disorders have a characteristic cytogenetic feature, chromosome instability. They are all autosomal recessive, show an increased tendency for chromosomal aberrations and to develop malignancies. Ataxia telangiectasia (AT), Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), and an ataxia-like disorder (ATLD), are chromosome instability disorders that are defective in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), NBS, and Mre11 genes, respectively. These genes are critical in maintaining cellular resistance to ionizing radiation (IR), which kills largely by the production of double-strand breaks (DSBs). Bloom syndrome involves a defect in the BLM helicase, which seems to play a role in restarting DNA replication forks that are blocked at lesions, thereby promoting chromosome stability. A point mutational change in DNA ligase I was identified in a unique immunodeficient individual who suffered recurrent sinopulmonary infection leading to bronchiectasis. A non-inactivating mutational change in DNA ligase IV has also been identified in a leukaemia patient, who was dramatically over-sensitive to radiotherapy.","Primary immunodeficiency"

"H02398","COVID-19","Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious respiratory infection that is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 infects alveolar epithelial cells [mainly alveolar epithelial type 2 (AEC2) cells] through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Upon the occupancy of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2, the increased serum level of free Angiotensin II (Ang II) due to a reduction of ACE2-mediated degradation promotes activation of the NF-kappa B pathway via Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R), followed by  interleukin-6 (IL-6) production. SARS-CoV-2 also activates the innate immune system; macrophage stimulation triggers the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, and the 'cytokine storm', which results in systemic inflammatory response syndrome and multiple organ failure. The combined effects of complement activation, dysregulated neutrophilia, endothelial injury, and hypercoagulability appear to be intertwined to drive the severe features of COVID-19.","Infectious disease"

"H01726","Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis","Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) represents a pattern of glomerular injury, characterized by mesangial proliferation and expansion, lobularization of the glomerular tufts and double contours. Classification of MPGN has been updated in the 2010s, and is now categorized according to the immunofluorescence microscopy findings. Until recently, the MPGNs have been distinguished according to the histological and ultra structural findings and were classified as MPGN type I, type II and type III. A new terminology that distinguishes immunoglobulin-mediated MPGN (ie, the former type I) from complement-mediated MPGN has been proposed. Immune-complexes mediated MPGN is caused by the deposition of immunocomplexes in the glomeruli. The immunocomplexes activate the classical pathway (CP) of complement and cause the deposition of complement factors or of the membrane attack complex (MAC) in the mesangium and capillary loops. The most frequent underlying disorders associated with immune complex MPGN include chronic infections, autoimmune diseases, and monoclonal gammopathies. The complement-mediated MPGN, termed C3 glomerulopathy, is characterised by defects in the alternative pathway of complement, in particular of factor H, or autoantibodies to complement-regulatory proteins (so-called C3 nephritic factors) leading to increased complement activation. The group includes dense deposit disease (DDD) and C3 glomerulonephritis. The two entities are distinguished on the basis of the immunohistological pattern of C3 and the electron microscopy detection of ribbon-like electron-dense deposits in the glomerular basement membrane in DDD, versus deposits of usual density in C3 glomerulonephritis.","Immune system disease; Urinary system disease"

"H00056","Alzheimer disease","Alzheimer disease (AD) is a chronic disorder that slowly destroys neurons and causes serious cognitive disability. AD is associated with senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Amyloid-beta (Abeta), a major component of senile plaques, has various pathological effects on cell and organelle function. To date genetic studies have revealed four genes that may be linked to autosomal dominant or familial early onset AD (FAD). These four genes include: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). All mutations associated with APP and PS proteins can lead to an increase in the production of Abeta peptides, specfically the more amyloidogenic form, Abeta42. It was proposed that Abeta form Ca2+ permeable pores and bind to and modulate multiple synaptic proteins, including NMDAR, mGluR5 and VGCC, leading to the overfilling of neurons with calcium ions. Consequently, cellular Ca2+ disruptions will lead to neuronal apoptosis, autophagy deficits, mitochondrial abnormality, defective neurotransmission, impaired synaptic plasticity and neurodegeneration in AD. FAD-linked PS1 mutation downregulates the unfolded protein response and leads to vulnerability to ER stress.","Neurodegenerative disease"

"H01578","Subacute myelo-optico-neuropathy (SMON)","Subacute myelo-optico-neuropathy (SMON) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder caused by poisoning due to over-dose and prolonged oral administration of clioquinol. SMON is characterized by subacute onset of sensory and motor disorders in the lower half of the body and visual impairment preceded by abdominal symptoms, such as abdominal pain and diarrhea. Despite clinical features mimicking infection or multiple sclerosis, the discovery of the green hairy tongue and the green urine in SMON patients aroused researchers' interest and thereby began solving the cause of SMON. The green color was derived from a chelate compound of clioquinol with ferric iron. A large number of SMON were observed throughout Japan, and the total number of cases reached nearly 10,000 by 1970. After the governmental ban on the use of clioquinol in September 1970, there was a dramatic disappearance of new case of SMON. However, in Japan, there are still more than 2500 SMON patients suffering from severe dysesthesia/paresthesia and ataxic paraplegia.","Neurodegenerative disease"

"H01855","Biliary atresia","Biliary atresia (BA) is a congenital, fibro-obliterative obstructive cholangiopathy. It can be a devastating disease in infants invariably leading, if untreated, to cirrhosis, liver failure and death. Patients will be jaundiced and will have pale stools and dark urine. This is due to the inability to excrete conjugated bilirubin into the gastrointestinal tract, which is then excreted into the urine causing its color to darken. The cause of BA is not known with any degree of certainty, though there are a number of hypotheses. One prominent theory regarding the pathogenesis is that bile duct injury is initially caused by a viral infection, and then perpetuated by an autoimmune disorder. Surgical drainage, the only effective intervention, is successful only half of the time. Approximately 80% of patients require one or more liver transplantations with the associated morbidity and mortality issues caused by life-long transplant-related immunosuppression.","Congenital malformation"
"H00987","Fetal akinesia deformation sequence","Fetal akinesia deformation sequence (FADS) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by impaired fetal movement and resulting developmental defects.

"H01607","Galactorrhea","Galactorrhea is a discharge of milk or a milk-like secretion from the breast in the absence of parturition or beyond six months' post-partum in a nonbreastfeeding woman. The condition is more common in women who are 20 to 35 years of age and in previously parous women. It is less common in children and nulligravid women. Galactorrhea also can occur in men. After infancy, galactorrhea usually is medication-induced. The most common pathologic cause of galactorrhea is a pituitary tumor. Other causes include hypothalamic and pituitary stalk lesions, neurogenic stimulation, thyroid disorders, and chronic renal failure. Tests for pregnancy, serum prolactin level and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and magnetic resonance imaging are important diagnostic tools that should be employed when clinically indicated. The decision to treat patients with galactorrhea is based on the serum prolactin level, the severity of galactorrhea, and the patient's fertility desires. Dopamine agonists are the treatment of choice in most patients with hyperprolactinemic disorders. Medications causing hyperprolactinemia should be discontinued or replaced with a medication from a similar class with lower potential for causing hyperprolactinemia. For women who cannot breastfeed after childbirth for some reasons, various pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions have been used to suppress lactation and relieve associated symptoms. Pharmacological options mainly involve dopamine agonist medications.","Reproductive system disease"

NDM is categorized into transient (TNDM) and permanent (PNDM). TNDM is a developmental disorder of insulin production that resolves by age 18 months but can reappear later in life. TNDM is different from type 1 diabetes since no islet cell antibodies or autoimmune phenomenon were found in these patients. 6q24-related TNDM is an imprinting disorder resulting from overexpression of at least two imprinted genes, PLAGL1 and HYMAI, on chromosome 6q24. Hypomethylation of multiple imprinted loci is associated with mutations in ZFP57. Mutations in ABCC8 and KCNJ11 encoding Kir6.2 and SUR1 are other genetic causes of TNDM.","Metabolic disease; Endocrine disease"

"H01638","Neuropathic pain","Neuropathic pain is defined as pain caused by a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory nervous system, and may be generated by either the peripheral or central nervous system, or both. It is especially problematic because of its severity, chronicity and resistance to simple analgesics. It may result from various causes including cervical or lumbar radiculopathy, diabetic neuropathy, cancer-related neuropathic pain, postherpetic neuralgia, HIV-related neuropathy, spinal cord injury, trigeminal neuralgia and complex regional pain syndrome type II, among others. Treatments are generally palliative and include conservative nonpharmacologic therapies, drugs and interventional therapies such as spinal cord stimulation. Analgesic agents recommended for first-line treatments are gabapentinoids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).","Nervous system disease"
"H01852","Postaxial polydactyly","Postaxial polydactyly (PAP) is one of the commonest congenital malformations. Both isolated and syndromic forms of PAP have been reported. PAP is characterized by duplication of the fifth finger/toe on the ulnar/fibular side of hands/feet. A small projection of tissue or scar mark just below the proximal interphalangeal crease can also be the only clinical finding. PAP is clinically classified into type A (PAPA) with fully developed extra digit and type B (PAPB) with incompletely developed digit. PAPA is a genetically heterogeneous disorder and exhibits as either autosomal dominant or recessive manner of inheritance. Given that both isolated PAPA1 and PAPB are caused by the mutations in the GLI3 gene, PAPB may considered as a variant of PAPA1 in genetics.","Congenital malformation"

"H01698","Giant cell arteritis","Giant cell arteritis (GCA), also known as temporal arteritis, is a chronic and polygenic immune-mediated disease of unknown etiology. It is the most common form of vasculitis in individuals over the age of 50 in Western countries. It is characterized by inflammatory damage of the aorta and/or aortic branches, particularly the temporal artery, which can lead to severe complications such as blindness or cerebrovascular disorders. GCA is twice as common in women. It is frequently associated with polymyalgia rheumatica. Laboratory tests usually reveal high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and other acute phase proteins, anemia of chronic disease, and thrombocytosis. Genetic association studies have described several genes that are associated with predisposition to GCA, including genes of immune-inflammatory pathways and genes of the HLA class I and II regions. The HLA-DRB1*04 alleles seem to be the most consistently associated genetic risk factors for GCA. Outside the HLA region, the most significant loci included PTPN22. Glucocorticoids are currently the mainstay of treatment for GCA but are associated with frequent adverse events. Tocilizumab, a humanised antihuman IL-6 receptor antibody, has been used successfully in several reports as a treatment of GCA.","Immune system disease; Cardiovascular disease; Nervous system disease"
"H00578","Epstein syndrome","Epstein syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant progressive nephropathy associated with macrothrombocytopenia. Sensorineural hearing loss can also occur. It is linked to mutations in MYH9, the nonmuscle myosin heavy chain. It has been suggested that renoprotective treatment by renin-angiotensin system blockade is effective in reducing proteinuria in patients with MYH9 nephropathy.","Cardiovascular disease"
"H01237","Sulfite oxidase deficiency","Sulfite oxidase deficiency is a rare inherited disease with severe neurological symptoms such as intractable neonatal or infantile seizures, hypotonia or hypertonia, feeding difficulties, profound developmental delay, and dislocated lens. Isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency results from defects in the enzyme sulfite oxidase, which is responsible for the oxidation of sulfite to sulfate. Several mutations have been identified from patients suffering from isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency. The more common molybdenum cofactor deficiency [DS:H00192] leads to combined defects in xanthine dehydrogenase and sulfite oxidase, as sulfite oxidase is 1 of 3 enzymes in humans that requires molybdenum as a cofactor, the other 2 being xanthine oxidase and aldehyde oxidase. The seizures in isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency may even begin prenatally, and are much more severe compared with those in molybdenum cofactor deficiency.","Inherited metabolic disease; Nervous system disease"
"H01005","Dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency","Dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) deficiency is a very rare form of primary autonomic failure characterized by cardiovascular disorders and severe orthostatic hypotension.

All patients have normal intellectual development; Treacher Collins syndrome [DS:H00610] is therefore a possible differential diagnosis. Mutations in TXNL4A, encoding a protein of the major spliceosome, have been identified as the cause of BMKS.","Congenital malformation"
"H01461","Crow-Fukase syndrome","Crow-Fukase syndrome, also called POEMS syndrome, is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome due to an underlying plasma cell neoplasm, characterized by polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes as its salient features. Major diagnostic criteria include sclerotic bone lesions, elevated serum or plasma levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and Castleman disease. The misdiagnosis is very common due to its rarity and complicated clinical manifestations. Recognition of the complex of clinical complications is the first step in effectively managing the disease. The pathogenesis is not well understood. VEGF appears to play an important role in the disease and is especially useful for monitoring therapy, but it is not likely the sole factor driving the disease. The most commonly used therapies include alkylators and steroids, high-dose chemotherapy with peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, lenalidomide, and bortezomib.","Other disease"
"H00781","Schopf-Schulz-Passarge syndrome","Schopf-Schulz-Passarge syndrome is a rare ectodermal dysplasia resulted from mutations in the WNT10A. The combination of multiple eyelid apocrine hidrocystomas, hypodontia, palmoplantar keratoderma, hypotrichosis and nail dystrophy characterize the disease.","Congenital malformation"
"H01653","Bipolar disorder","Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic depressive illness, is a severe chronic mood disorder, characterized by the recurrence of mania (hypomania), depression, or mixed episodes. It is one of the main causes of disability among young people, leading to cognitive and functional impairment and raised mortality, particularly death by suicide. Mania is the most characteristic phase of bipolar disorder. While mood elevation and euphoria are commonly described phenotypic descriptors of mania, irritability and anger may dominate. At the present time, there is solid evidence supporting the use of lithium, the anticonvulsants valproate and carbamazepine, and some antipsychotics in mania. Manic or hypomanic episodes differ in severity and length. In a hypomanic episode, a disturbance in functioning can be seen by others but does not typically cause severe impairment or require admission to hospital. At onset, most patients with bipolar disorder present with a depressive episode that differs subtly from unipolar depression. The first step in the management of bipolar disorder is to confirm the diagnosis of mania or hypomania and define the patient's mood state, because the therapeutic approach differs considerably for hypomania, mania, depression, and euthymia. While effective pharmacological treatments exist for bipolar disorder, the pathophysiology of the condition essentially remains unknown. Although bipolar disorder is one of the most heritable psychiatric disorders, a multifactorial model in which gene and environment interact is currently thought to best fit this disorder. Many risk alleles of small effect which are described in genome-wide association studies, contribute to the polygenic risk of bipolar disorder. It is suggested that the dopaminergic system may play a central role in bipolar disorder, although no singular dysfunction of neurotransmitter systems has been identified.","Mental and behavioural disorder"
"H00547","Atrioventricular septal defect","Atrioventricular septal defect, also known as atrioventricular canal defect or endocardial cushion defect, is a congenital heart malformation involving the interatrial septum, interventricular septum, and atrioventricular valves.

"H01495","Meniere disease","Meniere disease is an inner ear disorder characterized by episodic vertigo attacks, sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness. Prevailing theories on its pathogenesis point to endolymphatic hydrops as one derangement responsible for producing dysfunction within the cochlea and peripheral vestibular apparatus. Although the familial clustering and the geographical and racial differences in incidence suggest a certain role for genetic factors in the development of Meniere disease, no convincing evidence for an association with any gene exists, at present.","Nervous system disease"

"H00775","Hemiplegic migraine","Sporadic and familial hemiplegic migraines (SHM and FHM) are rare paroxysmal disorders characterized by motor aura and headache. The distinction is based on whether at least one first or second degree relative is also affected, otherwise the diagnostic criteria are similar. The majority of FHM families have a mutation in one of the ion channels CACNA1A, ATP1A2 and SCN1A. SHM is sometimes caused by a de novo mutation in one of the genes. However, at least a quarter of the large families affected and most sporadic cases do not have a mutation in the three genes known to be implicated in this disorder, suggesting that other genes are still to be identified.","Nervous system disease"

"H00124","GM2 gangliosidoses","GM2 gangliosidoses are a group of autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorders caused by deficiency of beta-hexosaminiase or the noncatalytic GM2 activator in glycosphingolipid catabolism. The enzymatic defect results in the accumulation of GM2 ganglioside in neurons that mainly affects motor and spinocerebellar function. Mutations of the HEXA gene cause deficiency of the beta-hexosaminidase A and result in Tay-Sachs disease. Mutations of the HEXB gene, encoding the beta-subunit, cause deficiency of both enzymes (beta-hexosaminidase A and B), leading to Sandhoff disease. Deficiency of the GM2 activator protein, which mediates the interaction between the water-soluble beta-hexosaminidase A and GM2 ganglioside, causes the AB variant of GM2 gangliosidosis.","Inherited metabolic disease; Lysosomal storage disease; Nervous system disease"

"H01492","Systemic sclerosis","Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) is an autoimmune disease that is characterized by fibrosis of the skin and major internal organs. The core symptoms of this disease are Raynaud's phenomenon, skin thickening, Nail-fold capillary, and serum autoantibody production. Systemic sclerosis can manifest as either the diffuse or the limited variant, distinguished by the degree and the extent of cutaneous sclerosis. A highly variable clinical course exists that spans from mild and subtle findings to aggressive life-threatening multisystem disease. Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) are present in more than 90% of patients, and these ANA react against various intracellular components. However, one patient rarely has two or more types of ANA. The particular ANA types are often indicative of clinical features, disease course and overall severity. At present, there is no treatment that has been proven to modify the overall disease course, but therapy that targets specific organ involvement early before irreversible damage occurs does improve both quality of life and survival. Although the precise pathogenesis of this disease remains unknown, the consensus is that it is triggered in genetically-susceptible individuals by exposure to specific environmental agents.","Immune system disease; Skin and connective tissue disease"
"H02217","Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy","Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME/EJM) is the most common form of idiopathic generalized epilepsy. JME appears around puberty and is characterized by seizures with bilateral and irregular myoclonic jerks, predominantly in the arms. No disturbance of consciousness is noticeable.

HSS is a rare autosomal dominant form that affects men and women equally. It is characterized by progressing hair loss from childhood, culminating in an almost complete loss of scalp hair by the third decade.","Skin disease"
"H01654","Lichen planus","Lichen planus (LP) is a chronic inflammatory and immune mediated skin disease with characteristic clinical and histopathologic features. The skin and oral mucosa are the most frequently involved areas. Other mucous membranes (including the genitalia, esophagus, and conjunctiva) and skin appendages (e.g., scalp hair and nails) can also be affected. The etiology and pathogenesis of LP remain unclear. An autoimmune reaction in which CD8+-T lymphocytes attack basal keratinocytes leading to apoptosis of the cells has been favored. Various potential triggers, e.g. viral or bacterial antigens, metal ions, drugs or physical factors, could initiate the autoimmune process. Nonetheless, the role of the individual trigger factors is controversial. There is a significant association between lichen planus and infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV). The diagnosis of LP is based on the clinical presentation and should be confirmed by biopsy, if suspected. Histopathology is often conclusive, but in vesiculobullous cutaneous LP or erosive oral LP, direct immunofluorescence (DIF) studies can be an integral step in differentiating between LP and other diseases. With few exceptions, all forms of LP are treated with the same measures. Depending on the severity of the findings, topical and systemic treatment options are available.","Skin and connective tissue disease; Immune system disease"
"H01466","Ulcerative colitis","Ulcerative colitis (UC) is one subtype of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) whose pathogenesis is multifactorial and includes influences from genes, the environment, and the gut microbiome. In UC the inflammatory is limited to the musoca of the colon and rectum. Clinically, the most common manifestation of UC may include bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain. In most severe cases, patients may experience fever, weight loss, anemia, and the intestine can get distended, presenting deep ulceration and possibly intestinal perforation.The long-time duration of the disease increases a colorectal caner risk. UC is associated with a Th2 immune response. Recent genetic analyses have linked genes including interleukin 23 receptor, interleukin 10 and macrophage stimulating 1.","Immune system disease"
"H01002","Generalized arterial calcification of infancy","Generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI) is a rare and often fatal genetic disorder, characterized by calcification of the internal elastic lamina, fibrotic myointimal proliferation of muscular arteries, and resultant arterial stenosis.

"H01837","Congenital suprabulbar paresis","Congenital suprabulbar paresis (Worster- Drought syndrome) is a permanent movement disorder of the bulbar muscles causing persistent difficulties with swallowing, feeding, speech, and saliva control owing to a non-progressive disturbance in early brain development. Owing to the paresis of the orbicularis oris the patient is unable to round the lips or to blow, but as other facial muscles are not affected he can smile normally and close his eyes. An increased jaw jerk and a positive snout reflex are sometimes found, suggesting an upper motor neurone lesion. Congenital suprabulbar paresis has not yet been recognised in the literature as a genetic entity but occasional familial cases suggest that it may have a genetic basis.","Nervous system disease"
"H01696","Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis","Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a progressive, fatal neurologic disorder of childhood and early adolescence. It is caused by a persistent infection of the brain by an aberrant measles virus. Signs attributable to subacute sclerosing panencephalitis usually develop 4-8 years after the onset of measles infection. It is not precisely known how the measles virus remains dormant for so many years and why it becomes active again. More recent data indicate that it can follow acute measles infection in 1:10,000 cases. The incidence of SSPE is inversely related to measles vaccination coverage. In the developed world, the prevalence of SSPE has steadily declined since the introduction of the measles virus vaccine. The characteristic clinical manifestations of SSPE include behavioral abnormalities, cognitive decline, myoclonic jerks, seizures and abnormalities in vision. Clinical manifestations of SSPE usually start with subtle intellectual deterioration of the affected child causing deterioration in school performance. One of the most characteristic manifestations of SSPE is periodic myoclonic jerks that often leads to difficulty in walking and repeated falls. In the terminal stages of the disease, decerebrate and decorticate rigidity appear. Ultimately the patient becomes vegetative. Management of the disease includes seizure control and avoidance of secondary complications associated with the progressive disability. Treatment with interferon, ribavirin, and isoprinosine have reported beneficial results. However, there is no definitively effective treatment for SSPE.","Infectious disease; Neurodegenerative disease"
"H00744","Potassium-aggravated myotonia","Potassium-aggravated myotonia (PAM), which is also known as sodium channel myotonia (SCM), is a group of pure myotonic disorders caused by mutations in the SCN4A gene. PAM includes three diseases with very similar phenotypes: myotonia fluctuans, myotonia permanens, and acetazolamide-sensitive myotonia. These disorders differ from the other nondystrophic myotonias in that: (1) the myotonia is exacerbated by potassium ingestion; (2) the myotonia does not worsen with cold exposure; and (3) there is no major weakness.","Nervous system disease; Musculoskeletal disease"

Persistent infection can cause inflammation and gastritis that may lead to carcinogenesis. Transmission is still not entirely clarified, but human-to-human spread through oral-oral or fecal-oral route is thought to be the most plausible. The prevalence of HP infection varies between different geographical regions; generally, the prevalence is about 30% in developed and up to 80% in developing countries. Although HP may sometimes be eradicated by antibiotics given for other infections, infection usually persists life-long unless specific combination antibiotic therapy is taken.","Infectious disease"

"H01808","Hemiconvulsion-hemiplegia-epilepsy syndrome","Hemiconvulsion-hemiplegia-epilepsy (HHE) syndrome is a rare condition involving sudden and prolonged unilateral seizures in infancy and early childhood, followed by hemiplegia. The prolonged focal motor seizure usually occurs during the course of a febrile illness and is followed by hemiplegia ipsilateral to the side of convulsions. Although hemiplegia is usually permanent, it may disappear in about 20% of cases. Some patients with familial hemiplegic migraine and manifesting the S218L mutation in CACNA1A were reported to experience severe attacks with unilateral cerebral edema after trivial head trauma. It has shown that CACNA1A associate with HHE and familial hemiplegic migraine, and suggested that similar pathogenic mechanisms may underlie these two disorders.","Nervous system disease"
"H01206","Plasminogen deficiency","Plasminogen deficiency is characterized by decreased serum plasminogen activity. Two forms of the disorder are distinguished. Type 1, also called hypoplasminogenemia, is associated with pseudomembrane disease. Ligneous conjunctivitis is the most common of the clinical syndromes associated with plasminogen deficiency, although numerous other organs have been reported to be affected. Type 2, also known as dysplasminogenemia, is characterized by normal, or slightly reduced antigen levels, and absence of clinical manifestations.","Hematologic disease"

It has been reported that mutations in MED25 cause this syndrome.","Congenital malformation"
"H01662","Generalized anxiety disorder","Generalized anxiety disorder is a persistent and common mental disorder. This disorder is twice as common in women than it is in men. The symptoms include generalised and persistent excessive anxiety and a combination of various psychological and somatic complaints, such as threat, restlessness, irritability, sleep disturbance, tension, palpitations, dry mouth, and sweating. The symptoms overlap greatly with those of other mental disorders and we could regard the disorder as part of a spectrum of mood and related disorders rather than an independent disorder. Generalized anxiety disorder has a relapsing course, and intervention rarely results in complete resolution of symptoms. But in the short term and medium term, effective treatments include psychological therapies, such as cognitive behavioural therapy, and pharmacological treatments, mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).","Mental and behavioural disorder"
"H01450","Obsessive-compulsive disorder","Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a psychiatric disorder characterized by recurrent, intrusive and disturbing thoughts as well as by repetitive stereotypic behaviors. OCD is a complex disorder and its pathogenesis is most likely influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Although more than 140 candidate gene studies have been conducted, the findings have been inconclusive due to small sample size and few study replications. Many studies suggest that abnormal serotonergic neurotransmission is one of the most consistent biological findings in OCD. Studies have also reported dopaminergic abnormalities in the basal ganglia and nucleus accumbens, as well as altered glutamate transmission. First line treatments for this disorder are cognitive behavioral therapy (exposure and response prevention) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In recent years, one of the promising novel treatment strategies developed to improve the efficacy of treatment for patients with OCD is acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). Recent studies have suggested that age of onset is an important factor in subtyping OCD. Early-onset OCD has been proposed to be associated with greater symptom severity, a higher prevalence of tic-related disorders, a more familial form of the condition, and a greater prevalence of psychiatry disorders in first-degree relatives as compared to late-onset OCD.","Mental and behavioural disorder"
"H00582","Benign familial hematuria","Benign familial hematuria is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by recurrent dysmorphic hematuria detected in childhood.

"H01468","Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis","Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is a systemic vasculitic disorder of unknown etiology that affects small-to-medium-size blood vessels. This disease has been called Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS) for many years, and renamed eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) in 2012. EGPA is characterized by asthma, hypereosinophilia, and extravascular eosinophilic granulomas. Clinically, three phases may be distinguished. The prodromal phase may persist for many years, consisting of asthma possibly associated with allergic rhinitis and often complicated by recurrent rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. The second phase is characterized by peripheral blood eosinophilia or eosinophilic tissue infiltrates. The third phase is dominated by manifestations resulting from systemic vasculitis. Vasculitis commonly affects the skin, nerves, gastrointestinal tract, and heart. It can be serious and life-threatening. EGPA pathogenesis is not well known. The disease is probably the result of a complex interaction in which genetically and environmental factors lead to an inflammatory response whose principal players are eosinophils, T, and B lymphocytes. HLA-DRB1 and DRB4 alleles and IL10.2 haplotype of the IL-10 promoter gene are the most studied genetic determinants. A combination of high-dose corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide is still the gold standard for the treatment of severe cases, but the use of biological agents such as rituximab or mepolizumab seems to be a promising therapeutic alternative.","Cardiovascular disease"
"H02219","DDOD syndrome","Dominant deafness-onychodystrophy (DDOD) is an autosomal dominant syndrome characterized mainly by congenital sensorineural hearing loss accompanied by dystrophic or absent nails. Patients with DDOD syndrome have normal development and cognitive functions. It has been suggested that de novo mutation in ATP6V1B2 impairs lysosome acidification and causes DDOD.","Congenital malformation"
"H00916","Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome","Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a disorder characterized by an idiopathic failure of the automatic control of breathing. It is frequently associated with a broad spectrum of dysautonomic symptoms, suggesting the involvement of genes widely expressed in the autonomic nervous system. In particular, the ASCL1-PHOX2A-PHOX2B developmental cascade was proposed as a candidate pathway. Recently, It has been showed that PHOX2B is the major CCHS locus, whose mutation accounts for 60% of cases.","Nervous system disease"
"H01457","Diabetic retinopathy","Diabetic retinopathy (DR), one of the most common vascular complication of diabetes, is the leading cause of visual deficits and blindness around the world. The development of DR is divided into two stages: in the early stages, also called as nonproliferative stage, it is asymptomatic because the signs are not visible to the eye. however, some defects including microaneurysms, intraretinal hemorrhaging, narrowing or blocked retinal blood vessels can be seen by detection; in the second stage, known as proliferative diabetic retinopathy, where neovascularization appears at the back of the eye and extend into the vitreous of the eye, and these new blood vessels are fragile. If they leak blood, the bleeding causes shrinkage of the retina, leading to retinal detachment, and ultimately to blindness. It has been reported that vascular endothelial growth factor A, angiotensin-converting enzyme, paraoxonase, erythropoietin are associated with DR development and progression.","Endocrine and metabolic disease; Nervous system disease"
"H00585","Epidermolysis bullosa, hemidesmosomal","Inherited epidermolysis bullosa is a diverse group of disorders characterized by mechanically fragile skin that readily blister.

It is histologically indistinguishable from primary epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) and is diagnosed in the absence of another identifiable primary. Most reported PPC cases are primary peritoneal serous papillary carcinoma (PPSPC), while peritoneal mixed epithelial carcinoma (MEC) and malignant mixed Mullerian tumor (MMMT) are rarely reported. Germline BRCA1 mutations in 26% of PPSPC patients was detected. BRCA1 mutation carriers had a higher overall incidence of p53 mutations than wildtype BRCA1 case subjects. It is suggested that p53 has a unique role in the development and progression of BRCA1-related PPSPC.","Cancer"

"H01691","Renal angiomyolipoma","Renal angiomyolipoma (AML) is one of the most common solid benign renal tumours, composed of fat, smooth muscle, and blood vessels. About 80% of AMLs are sporadic and not associated with any genetic syndrome. Remaining cases are associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). The pathogenesis of TSC is thought to result from mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 genes that encode the proteins tuberin and hamartin, respectively. These proteins interact with each other to form heterodimers, whose most important role is inhibition of the mTOR pathway. Loss of inhibition of mTORC1 leads to increased activation of this pathway and the formation of the lesions characteristic of TSC. Sporadic renal AML usually have mutations in TSC2, but not TSC1.","Urinary system disease"

This disorder is characterized by progressive behavioral, cognitive and neurologic deficit.","Inherited metabolic disease; Neurodegenerative disease; Peroxisomal disease"
"H01898","PNPLA6-related disorders","PNPLA6-related disorders have been implicated in a broad spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders. The phenotypic spectrum includes at least four clinical key features: ataxia, motor neuron disease (upper motor neuron disease with or without additional lower motor neuropathy), hypogonadism, and chorioretinal dystrophy. Although these clinical features appear to be frequent in PNPLA6 disease none of them is an obligate feature of the disease. The majority of the PNPLA6 mutations affect a phospholipid esterase domain in neuropathy target esterase (NTE), which has been shown to de-esterify phosphatidylcholine, a major component of biological membranes, into its constituent fatty acids and glycerophosphocholine. Other phenotypes caused by NTE dysfunction due to PNPLA6 mutations include anterior hypopituitarism, trichomegaly, alopecia, and facial dysmorphisms.","Nervous system disease"

"H01606","Polymyalgia rheumatica","Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a relatively common inflammatory rheumatic disease in people older than 50 years of age. PMR is a clinical condition defined as the presence of inflammatory pain in the limb girdles. Range of motion is decreased at the shoulder and pelvic girdles, and the neck and hip girdle may also be involved. These symptoms often persist for at least 1 month and are combined with incapacitating morning stiffness, a decline in general health, and an elevated acute-phase response. Onset of PMR symptoms may be acute or gradual. It is known that PMR patients share many pathogenetic features with giant cell arteritis (GCA). Despite the similarities in age of onset and some of the clinical manifestations, the relationship between GCA and PMR is not yet clearly established. One-third of PMR patients have systemic manifestations such as low-grade fever, malaise, and anorexia, but these are often milder than systemic symptoms in GCA patients. PMR is a benign and highly steroid-sensitive disease that should resolve fully with low-dose glucocorticoid therapy for 12-24 months, although one or two relapses may occur. The diagnosis of PMR is made primarily on clinical grounds and is bolstered by laboratory evidence of an acute-phase reaction. There is no single diagnostic test for PMR, but sets of diagnostic and classification criteria have been suggested by several groups of investigators.","Musculoskeletal disease"

SRS is associated with genetic or epigenetic mutations that affect two different chromosomes. In addition to maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7, hypomethylation of the imprinting control region 1 (ICR1) in 11p15 and maternal duplication of 11p15 have recently been described as major epigenetic disturbances in SRS. The ICR1 regulates expression of the paternally expressed IGF2 and the maternally expressed H19. The H19 gene encodes a 2.3-kb non-coding mRNA, which is strongly expressed during embryogenesis and possibly functions as a microRNA. It has been proposed that H19 hypomethylation leads to biallelic expression of this gene and downregulation of IGF2 expression resulting in growth retardation.","Congenital malformation"

The ductus arteriosus (DA) is a fetal specific vascular connection between the main pulmonary artery and the aorta. After birth, the DA normally closes within the first several days of life. If present after the age of 3 month, this condition is known as PDA. PDA can cause significant problems, especially in premature infants. It can be associated with an increased incidence of chronic lung disease, intraventricular hemorrhage, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Clinicians may choose to treat the PDA in an attempt to minimize the risk of these complications. Prostaglandin inhibition using indomethacin or ibuprofen is the standard strategy to close the DA. Surgical closure of the DA is an alternative option. Autosomal dominant forms of PDA caused by mutation in the TFAP2B and PRDM6 gene has been reported. PDA has been reported in a few subjects with thoracic aortic aneurysm and rare genetic variants in MYH11 and ACTA2.","Congenital malformation"

Its incidence peaks during three age periods: in the first three months of life, during puberty, and in adulthood with an apex at 40 to 60 years of age. The cause of SD is unknown and the disease seems to be multifactorial. Malassezia yeasts are considered to play an important role. They cause an inflammatory reaction that seems to be mediated by free fatty acids, released from sebaceous triglycerides by fungal enzymes such as lipases. The lipid layer of Malassezia can also modulate pro-inflammatory cytokine production by keratinocytes. Although it can be associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection and neurologic disease (e.g., cerebrovascular event, Parkinson disease), SD typically occurs in healthy persons.

Since neutrophils play a major role in host defense against bacteria, neutropenia patients suffer from frequent episodes of opportunistic bacterial infections. Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is a rare neutropenia with a bone marrow maturation arrest of granulocytic differentiation. Kostmann syndrome is an autosomal recessive SCN. The characteristic maturation arrest and the lack of mature neutrophils in peripheral blood of patients with Kostmann syndrome can be explained by the deletion of an anti-apoptotic factor (HAX-1) in myeloid cells of these patients. Heterozygous mutations in the protooncogene growth factor-independent 1 (GFI1) gene are also associated with SCN.

"H01677","Congenital hydrocephalus","Congenital hydrocephalus (HYC) is a common birth defect in the circulation of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It is characterized by ventricular dilatation. Although commonly considered a single disorder, hydrocephalus is a collection of a heterogeneous complex and multifactorial disorders. It may occur alone (non-syndromic) or as part of a syndrome with other anomalies. Almost 50% of all cases of hydrocephalus are congenital and these are usually associated with adverse neurological outcome. It is probably the consequence of abnormal brain development. Genetic factors are involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. Molecular genetic studies have revealed that the responsible gene for X-linked human congenital hydrocephalus is encoding for L1CAM. Although the recurrence risk for congenital hydrocephalus excluding X-linked hydrocephalus is low, recently, a few genes for autosomal recessive congenital hydrocephalus have been identified. Besides genetic factors, many other factors influence the development of congenital hydrocephalus, such as congenital malformations, intracerebral hemorrhage, maternal alcohol use, infection, and X-ray radiation during pregnancy.","Congenital malformation"

"H01683","Disorders of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion","Water imbalance is common among the critically ill. The excessive increases or decreases in body water can be lethal. There are numerous pathologic and iatrogenic causes for water imbalance, the most troublesome being disorders of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion. ADH is also known as arginine vasopressin (AVP). The prime determinant of free water excretion is the regulation of urinary flow by circulating levels of arginine vasopressin (AVP) in plasma. Disorders of water metabolism can be divided into hyperosmolar disorders, in which there is a deficiency of body water relative to body solute, and hypo-osmolar disorders, in which there is an excess of body water relative to body solute. The classical hyperosmolar disorder is diabetes insipidus (DI), and the classical hypo-osmolar disorder is the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).

"H00107","Other well-defined immunodeficiency syndromes","Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked recessive disease and characterized by immune dysregulation and microthrombocytopenia. Several nonsense and missense mutations as well as deletions and insertions of the WAS gene have been identified in WAS patients. DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome (DGS) is a congenital immune disorder characterized by lack of embryonic development or underdevelopment of the thymus and surrounding organs. The DGS is a member of a group of disorders that have in common a chromosome deletion involving 22q11.2 (the DiGeorge syndrome chromosome region, or DGCR). Hyper-IgE syndrome (HIES) is characterized by atopic dermatitis associated with extremely high serum IgE levels and susceptibility to infections with extracellular bacteria. Dominant-negative mutations in the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) gene result in the classical multisystem form of HIES, whereas a null mutation in the tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) gene causes an autosomal recessive HIES associated with viral and mycobacterial infections. X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome (XLP) is a rare primary immunodeficiency, with manifestations ranging from fatal infectious mononucleosis to B cell lymphomas and hypogammaglobulinemia. Mutations in the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) as well as in a distinct gene, SLAM-associated protein (SAP/DSP1/SH2D1A) have been identified in patients with XLP. Recently, it has been shown that a homozygous mutation in the SH2 domain of the IL-2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK) gene is associated with fatal Epstein Barr virus associated lymphoproliferation, with a clinical picture similar to that seen in XLP. Immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy and X-linked (IPEX) syndrome and autoimmune polyendocrinopathy, candidiasis, ectodermal dysplasia (APECED) are examples of dysregulated immunity resulting in a disturbed tolerance and multiple autoimmune phenomena. IPEX is caused by mutations in the FOXP3 gene, and APECED results from mutations in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene.

"H01648","Pemphigus","Pemphigus is an autoimmune blistering disease of the skin and mucous membranes characterized by circulating autoantibodies that target desmosomal components as well as other epithelial antigens and impair keratinocytes adhesion with subsequent acantholysis. Although the precise pathomechanisms of pemphigus have not yet been fully elucidated, recent studies have shown that desmosome disassembling involves not only the direct inhibition of desmosome formation caused by IgGs, but also desmosome remodeling. Pemphigus can be divided into non-inflammatory types, which are the major and common types, and inflammatory types, which are much less common and include necrolytic (apoptotic) type. Non-inflammatory pemphigus includes two types: pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF). The former is caused by autoantibodies to desmoglein (Dsg) 3 only or to both Dsg1 and Dsg3 and generates clinically multiple flaccid blisters and erosions due to acantholysis at the lower, typically along the suprabasal, layers in the epidermis and mucous membranes. The latter is caused by autoantibodies to Dsg1 and clinically characterized by very fragile superficial blisters and large leafy scales due to acantholysis at the granular cell layer in the epidermis, but not observed in the mucous membranes. Inflammatory types of pemphigus include pemphigus herpetiformis (PH), pemphigus vegetans (PVeg) and the so-called paraneoplastic pemphigus (PP). Because pemphigus is an autoimmune disease, the most common treatment is the administration of oral steroids to inhibit antibody production, combined with the use of topical agents to prevent infection, protect the eroded areas and promote epithelialization. Other concomitant therapy can include the use of immunosuppressants, plasma exchange, and the administration of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).","Skin and connective tissue disease; Immune system disease"

"H01641","Dry eye desease","Dry eye disease (also called keratoconjunctivitis sicca) is multifactorial disease of the tears, lids, and ocular surface which can result in symptoms of discomfort and/or visual disturbance and/or tear film instability with the potential for damage to the ocular surface. It is accompanied by increased osmolarity of the tear film and subacute inflammation of the ocular surface. Dry eye disease is subdivided into two forms, aqueous insufficiency (tear deficiency) and hyperevaporative (increased evaporation). However, mixed forms are common. Aqueous insufficiency is divided into two main groups: Sjogren's syndrome-related dry eye and non-Sjogren's syndrome-related dry eye (which includes the use of systemic medication). Dry eye in Sjogren's syndrome (an autoimmune disease) [DS:H01502] is often severe and requires more aggressive treatment. Evapourative dry eye is most commonly a result of meibomian gland dysfunction. Tests used to diagnose dry eye disease and to assess efficacy of treatments in clinical trials include the following: measurement of tear film break-up time (the interval between the individual's last complete blink and the break up of the tear film) using fluorescein (shortened in dry eye disease), evaluation of tear quantity with Schirmer's test (using a strip of filter paper placed under the lower eyelid), assessment of corneal and conjunctival epithelium integrity using stains and dyes, and evaluation of meibomian glands. Artificial tears of various kinds are recommended if the symptoms are mild. Lid hygiene is helpful in the treatment of hyperevaporative dry eye, while collagen or silicon plugs can be used for partial occlusion of the efferent lacrimal ducts to treat severe hyposecretory dry eye. The benefit of long-term topical anti-inflammatory treatment of moderate or severe dry eye disease with corticosteroids or cyclosporine A eye drops has been documented in clinical trials on a high evidence level. Orally administered tetraycycline derivatives and omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids are also used.","Nervous system disease"

AS may be present with several comorbid disorders including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and Tourette syndrome. The standard pharmacotherapies typically administered to other comorbid disorders are also prescribed to AS patients. Although medication therapy may be beneficial in stabilizing AS patients, it does not cure the disorder. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may be an effective behavioral approach to implement, and it may also reduce the number of pharmacotherapies necessary for AS patients. Although medication therapy may be beneficial in stabilizing AS patients, it does not cure the disorder. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may be an effective behavioral approach to implement, and it may also reduce the number of pharmacotherapies necessary for AS patients. The pathophysiology of AS remains unclear and the causes of AS are not known. The male-to-female ratio is 8:1 in AS. Genetic factors appear to play a role in AS because of their tendency to run in families and the high concordance in twins. However, a specific gene for AS has not been identified. Recent studies have suggested that the mutations in two X-linked genes, neuroligins NLGN3 and NLGN4 are associated with autism and AS.","Mental and behavioural disorder"

"H01849","Peripheral arteriovenous malformation","Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a congenital vascular malformation with direct communication from arteries to veins (arteriovenous shunting) and lack of a normal capillary network. The behavior of peripheral (extracranial) AVM is locally aggressive. AVMs are high-flow vascular malformations, and have a wide range of clinical presentations. Some patients may present with an asymptomatic birthmark, while in some patients, the condition may be even life-threatening, leading to congestive heart failure. Typically during puberty or adolescence, the initially quiescent lesion progresses to an expansive mass with cosmetic and functional disturbance. With later progression, the AVM destroys normal tissues and eventually leads to complications such as severe disfigurement, uncontrollable bleeding, ulceration, pain, and cardiac volume overload. A surgical approach is indicated in well-circumscribed malformations of small size. However, the surgical treatment of larger lesions can often lead to excessive blood loss, in addition to serious complications. Ligation or embolization of the arteries supplying the AVM is usually followed by recurrence.","Developmental disorder; Cardiovascular disease"

"H00705","Myotonia congenita","Myotonia congenita is a specific inherited disorder of muscle membrane hyperexcitability caused by reduced sarcolemmal chloride conductance due to mutations in CLCN1, the gene coding for the main skeletal muscle chloride channel ClC-1. Impaired functioning of the ClC-1 leads to an increase in sarcolemmal excitability that clinically presents as delayed muscular relaxation (myotonia). Myotonia congenita may be inherited as either an autosomal dominant (Thomsen disease) or recessive trait (Becker disease). The predominant features of Thomsen disease are a painless, transient, muscle stiffness with a predilection for both the upper extremity and the facial muscles. Compared with Thomsen disease, Becker disease is more common, more insidious, and has initial symptoms that occur later in childhood. Two additional forms of myotonia congenita have been described: myotonia levior and fluctuating myotonia congenita. Like Becker and Thomsen disease, both of these conditions are associated with a defect in the ClC-1. Whether these two entities are truly distinct disorders is under debate, and some propose that they are variants of Thomsen disease.","Nervous system disease; Musculoskeletal disease"

"H01240","Immune thrombocytopenia","Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an acquired autoimmune disorder, and the most common cause of isolated thrombocytopenia in children. Destruction of autoantibody-sensitized platelets by Fc[gamma]R-bearing phagocytic cells in the reticuloendothelial system plays an important role. ITP is diagnosed clinically, based upon onset of thrombocytopenia in the absence of other hematologic abnormalities, or other causes of low platelets, and with a characteristic blood smear. While around 50% of typical childhood acute ITP is preceded by a viral or bacterial infection and commonly resolves within weeks to months without treatment, fewer adult cases are acute and self-resolving. Typical adult primary ITP is very similar clinically to chronic pediatric ITP. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment and splenectomy (removal of the platelet-destructing organ) are effective treatment options. It has been reported that the activating FCGR2C-ORF genotype predisposes to ITP by altering the balance of activating and inhibitory Fc[gamma]R on immune cells.","Primary immunodeficiency; Hematologic disease"

It is an uncommon but important cause of fever of unknown origin (FUO). SAT is often preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection and occurs concurrently with outbreaks of viral diseases (mumps, measles, influenza). However, the exact etiology is unknown. Clinically, it presents with acute onset of pain in the thyroid region. The pain may be exacerbated by turning the head or swallowing, and may radiate to the jaw, ear or chest. Common initial clinical features include low-grade fever, fatigue, and mild thyrotoxic manifestations. The physical examination, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, an elevated thyroglobulin level, and a depressed radioactive iodine uptake confirm the diagnosis. Therapy with antithyroid drugs is not indicated in patients with SAT because this disorder is caused by the release of preformed thyroid hormone rather than synthesis of new T3 and T4. Therapy with beta blockers may be indicated for the symptomatic treatment of thyrotoxicosis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are generally effective in reducing thyroid pain in patients with mild cases. Patients with more severe disease require a tapering dosage of prednisone given over two to four weeks.","Endocrine disease"

It is a discrete, round, firm, often multiple uterine tumor composed of smooth muscle and connective tissue. The findings derived from high-throughput sequencing combined with previous knowledge have led to an emerging molecular classification of leiomyomas, suggesting that there are several distinct pathogenic pathways involved in leiomyoma formation. The evidence points to at least 4 molecular subclasses: leiomyomas with MED12 mutation, FH inactivation, HMGA2 overexpression, and COL4A6-COL4A5 deletion. While it is thought that the initial events that trigger leiomyoma tumorigenesis involves somatic mutations, it is evident that the development and growth of leiomyoma are highly dependent on ovarian steroid hormones, in particular, progesterone.","Reproductive system disease"

"H01682","Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone","The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is an endocrine disease, characterized by inappropriately concentrated urine, dilutional hyponatremia, and subsequent manifestations of various central nervous system (CNS) symptoms. Though usually transient, SIADH may be chronic. It is often associated with drug use or a lesion in the central nervous system or lung. SIADH is divided into two categories. One is the ectopic ADH syndrome induced by abnormally secreted arginine vasopressin (ADH/AVP) from cancer cells. Another is the morbidity caused by inappropriately secreted ADH from the pituitary gland. In both situations of SIADH, ADH binds to vasopressin V2 receptors (V2Rs) in renal tubules and thereby increasing water reabsorption. SIADH is difficult to distinguish from cerebral salt wasting syndrome (CSWS), another cause of hyponatremia characterized by renal loss of sodium and decreases in extracellular fluid volume during intracranial disorders. SIADH occurs in the setting of euvolemia, without evidence of renal disease or thyroxine or cortisol deficiency. Treatment options for SIADH include fluid restriction, demeclocycline, urea, frusemide and saline infusion, all of which have their limitations. The introduction of the vasopressin-2 receptor antagonists has allowed clinicians to specifically target the underlying pathophysiology of SIADH.","Endocrine disease"

They include C1 inhibitor (C1-INH, also termed SERPING1), C4 binding protein (C4BP), Factor I, decay accelerating factor (DAF), CD59, and so on. C1-INH (SERPING1) deficiency can be genetic or acquired, and this causes an episodic, local increase in vascular permeability in the subcutaneous and submucosal layers, identified as angioedema (hereditary or acquired). Genetic deficiency of C4BP has only been reported in one individual who developed an illness with similarities to Behcet's syndrome. Heterozygous mutations within the Factor I gene have been recently identified in individuals with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), while homozygous deficiency of Factor I is an unusual feature. Factor I-deficient patients present high susceptibility to respiratory tract infections and meningitis. Kidney impairment and autoimmune disorders have also been observed.

"H01020","Optic atrophy","Hereditary optic atrophy (OPA) is a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by a sudden or gradual loss of retinal ganglion cells function. OPA results from degeneration of the retinal ganglion cells whose axons form the optic nerve. Symptoms include a variable association of decreased visual acuity, visual field defects, and color vision abnormalities. All nonsyndromic OPAs characterized to date result from defects in genes encoding mitochondria-related proteins. The most frequent forms of nonsyndromic OPA are autosomal dominant OPA1-linked OPA (OPA1) and mitochondrial DNA-linked, maternally inherited Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). By contrast, autosomal recessive forms of optic atrophies (arOAs) are less frequent, and most cases are syndromic (e.g., OPA3 and OPA7).

The pathological characteristics are the presence of rimmed vacuoles in muscle fibers, but are not specific to this myopathy, and the presence of scattered small angular and atrophic fibers.","Nervous system disease; Musculoskeletal disease"
"H01676","Normal pressure hydrocephalus","Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a progressive brain disease characterized by gait impairment, urinary incontinence, and dementia, and by ventricular enlargement in the absence of elevated intracranial pressure. NPH can be secondary to disease processes that cause inflammation of the arachnoid, such as subarachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, or meningitis. As many as half of patients with NPH have no identifiable risk factor, and it is called idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (INPH). Although INPH is usually considered an acquired form of hydrocephalus because the onset of symptoms is not until late in life, it has been reported that a subset of patients with INPH may actually have congenital hydrocephalus. Symptoms can be alleviated with a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt.","Nervous system disease"
"H00139","alpha-Mannosidosis","Alpha-mannosidosis is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficient activity of alpha-mannosidase in glycoprotein catabolism. The enzymatic defect results in the accumulation of mannose-rich oligosaccharides in many organs. Alpha-mannosidosis is characterized by immune deficiency, facial and skeletal abnormalities, hearing impairment, and mental retardation. The disorder has been described as two distinct phenotypes: a severe form with hepatomegaly and early death following severe infections (type 1) and a mild form with hearing loss and mental retardation (type 2).","Inherited metabolic disease; Lysosomal storage disease"

"H01649","Schizophrenia","Schizophrenia is a common serious psychotic illness that typically emerges in late adolescence and early adulthood. It is characterized by hallucinations and delusions (commonly known as positive symptoms), social withdrawal, alogia, and flat affect (negative symptoms), and cognitive disabilities. While treatments exist for the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia, there is no effective therapy to prevent the cognitive impairments. The disorder is substantially heritable, but expression of the clinical phenotype is likely to involve the interplay of multiple susceptibility variants, epigenetic factors, and environmental influences. Although it has been suggested that many of the promising candidate genes are involved in the development and maintenance of synaptic function, the most of them remains to be identified. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying schizophrenia are unknown, but observers have repeatedly noted pathological features involving excessive loss of gray matter and reduced numbers of synaptic structures on neurons. Recently, it has been found that alleles of the C4 genes are associated with schizophrenia in proportion to their tendency to promote greater expression of C4A in the brain.","Mental and behavioural disorder"
"H01823","Myoclonic-astatic epilepsy","Myoclonic astatic epilepsy (MAE), also known as Doose syndrome, is a generalized epilepsy syndrome of young children that includes multiple different seizure types, of which myoclonic and astatic seizures were the most prominent. The electro- encephalogram (EEG) tracings may be normal initially, but later develop a characteristic biparietal theta background rhythm, and irregularly generalized spike wave, and polyspike wave discharges. In general, children are developmentally normal before the onset of epilepsy and organic brain abnormalities are absent. Long-term prognosis varies from cessation of seizures with normal developmental outcome to intractable epilepsy with mental retardation. Favorable outcomes were reported in half to two-thirds of cases. Treatment strategies such as corticosteroids, ethosuximide, and valproate have been described as only partially effective, but newer anticonvulsants, such as levetiracetam and zonisamide, may provide additional seizure control. The most effective treatment reported to date appears to be the ketogenic diet.","Nervous system disease"
"H01671","Neurosis","Neurosis is a class of functional mental disorders involving distress but neither delusions nor hallucinations, whereby behavior is not outside socially acceptable norms. The state of research on neurosis has moved towards looking at biological and genetic substrates or mechanisms underlying neurosis. The recent literature shows acceptance of common mental disorders such as Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), Panic disorder (PD), and Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), across cultures replacing neurotic disorder. Usage of the diagnosis of neurosis has been decreased, and replaced by newer categories in the current popular classificatory systems. In the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), all disorders regarded as neurosis remained together but under the division of rubric 'neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders'. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), neurosis has been eliminated as a category.","Mental and behavioural disorder"
"H01443","Viridans group streptococcal infection","The viridans group streptococci (VGS), a heterogenous group of streptococcal species, are the predominant species of the human oral flora and commonly inhabit other areas of the upper respiratory, gastrointestinal, and female genital tracts. VGS are usually organisms of low virulence. However, VGS are a major cause of sepsis and pneumonia in neutropenic individuals, and an important cause of sepsis and meningitis in neonates. These organisms are also occasional pathogens in healthy children and adults, causing infections such as subacute endocarditis. Although VGS resistance to penicillin and the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS) drugs is an evolving problem, several drugs remain uniformly active against the VGS. Thus far, VGS resistance to vancomycin, linezolid, and daptomycin remains extremely rare.","Infectious disease"
"H00591","Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy","Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a usually autosomal dominant inherited form of muscular dystrophy. At disease onset, typically in the second decade of life, FSHD is characterized by initially restricted weakness of shoulder and facial muscles. With progression, the lower extremities, both distal and proximal, become involved. FSHD is caused by a reduction in the copy number of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat. However, the reduction of D4Z4 copy number is not sufficient by itself to cause FSHD. A number of epigenetic events appear to affect the severity of the disease, its rate of progression, and the distribution of muscle weakness.","Nervous system disease; Musculoskeletal disease"

It is a rare, but underdiagnosed, complication of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) resulting from occlusion of large pulmonary arteries with a fibrothrombotic material and in many cases, the development of a distal vessel arteriopathy that closely mimics pulmonary arterial hypertension. While the pathogenesis of CTEPH is not entirely understood, the primary pathophysiology appears to be related to an initial thrombotic event followed by both inadequate thrombus resolution and secondary arteriopathy. Several risk factors for development of CTEPH have been found, including the size of the initial PE, splenectomy, chronic inflammatory conditions, and indwelling catheters and cardiac pacemaker leads. There is however an increased incidence of elevated factor VIII levels in CTEPH, and this finding persists after treatment.

"H01598","Addison disease","Primary adrenocortical insufficiency, also known as Addison disease, is a rare but fatal endocrine disorder characterized by the progressive destruction of the adorenal cortex, resulting in insufficient production of glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and adrenal androgens. Although tuberculosis remains a significant cause in developing countries, autoimmune adrenalitis is the most common cause of Addison disease in developed nations. It has also been reported that DAX1 mutations result in X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita (X-linked Addison disease). The clinical manifestations before a life-threatening adrenal crisis (shock, hypotension, and volume depletion) are subtle and can include hyperpigmentation, fatigue, anorexia, orthostasis, nausea, muscle and joint pain, and salt craving. Symptoms are gradual and worsen over a period of years, making early diagnosis difficult. Treatment for Addison disease consists of lifelong hormone therapy with glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids.","Endocrine disease"
"H00812","Trichomoniasis","Trichomoniasis is the most common curable sexually transmitted infection caused by a motile flagellate protozoan parasite.

"H01766","Juvenile retinoschisis","Juvenile retinoschisis is an early-onset X-linked retinal disease caused by mutations in retinoschisin (RS1), extracellular protein implicated in retinal cell adhesion. This disease is the leading cause of macular degeneration in males and leads to splitting within the inner retinal layers leading to visual deterioration. Affected persons typically display cystic streaks projecting from the parafoveal region of the retina, and a reduction in the b-wave amplitude of the full-field electroretinogram (ERG). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) further reveals a splitting of the outer plexiform and adjacent retinal layers.","Congenital malformation"
"H00486","Sclerosteosis","Sclerosteosis is a rare sclerosing bone dysplasias inherited in autosomal recessive manner. The main clinical features are enlargement of the jaw and facial bones, which can lead to secondary findings such as facial distortion, increased intracranial pressure often resulting in headaches, and entrapment of the cranial nerves. Other findings include syndactyly and tall stature. This disease is due to loss-of-function mutations in the SOST gene, a protein that bind to LRP5/6 and antagonize Wnt signaling. Recently, mutations in the LRP4 gene, coding for a Wnt signaling coreceptor, have been found in patients with sclerosteosis.","Congenital malformation"
"H01554","Fallopian tube cancer","Fallopian tube cancer is a rare, aggressive gynecologic malignancy. Recent genetic and immunohistochemical studies strongly suggest that high-grade serous adenocarcinoma (SAC) involving the ovary likely arises from distal fallopian tube epithelium, indicating that some ovarian cancers develop in the fallopian tube and are then spread to the ovary. Fallopian tube cancers are similar to ovarian cancer with respect to the proportion of tumors with abnormal expression of c-erbB-2 and p53. It has been proposed that the p53 signature is the earliest step in the pathogenesis of fallopian tube cancer. In this model, tubal epithelium on the fimbria experiences genotoxic damage and, as a result, the secretory cell exhibits over-accumulation of p53 protein (p53 signature). There is also some evidence that BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 mutations and c-myc have a major role in tumorgenesis.","Cancer"
"H02117","Neu-Laxova syndrome","Neu-Laxova syndrome (NLS) is an autosomal recessive multiple malformation syndrome characterized by a recognizable pattern of severe malformations leading to prenatal or early postnatal lethality. It is characterized by ichthyosis, marked intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), microcephaly, short neck, central nervous system anomalies, limb deformities, hypoplastic lungs, edema, and abnormal facial features.

In contrast, non-autoimmune hemorrhagic acquired F13 deficiency (HAF13D) is a less severe bleeding disease secondary to various disease conditions. AHFXIII must be distinguished from HAF13D since AHFXIII requires immunosuppressive therapy to eradicate autoantibodies in addition to F13 replacement therapy to arrest bleeding. Patients with acquired F13 deficiency, in particular those with AHFXIII, are on the increase, at least in Japan.","Hematologic disease"

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common type of vulvar cancer and is observed in 80% to 90% of cases. There are at least two quite different types of SCC of the vulva. The less common, accounting for about one-third of cases, occurs in relatively young women, is usually preceded by the undifferentiated form of vulvar squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) and is associated with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection; the more frequent form develops in elderly patients, is not commonly associated with undifferentiated VIN but is frequently associated with differentiated VIN, lichen sclerosus or squamous hyperplasia, and is generally not linked to HPV infection. Relatively little is known about molecular changes in the genesis of vulvar cancer. Some studies suggest that early p53 mutation may be a defining step only in HPV-negative tumors. A rather small study suggests that mutation in phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) is an early change in a substantial subset of vulvar carcinomas.","Cancer"

"H01106","Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 deficiency","Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) deficiency is a disorder resulting in increased fibrinolysis and an associated bleeding diathesis. PAI-1 is an important component of the coagulation system that down-regulates fibrinolysis in the circulation. Affected individuals exhibit mild to moderate bleeding symptoms, including epistaxis, menorrhagia, and delayed bleeding after trauma or surgical procedures. Spontaneous bleeding events are rarely seen in contrast to other procoagulant deficiencies. Generally most of the PAI-1-related diseases are due to elevated antigenic concentrations and their inhibitory activity. However, absence of cellular PAI-1 activity also causes several diseases. Clear documentation of PAI-1 deficiency as a cause of a bleeding disorder has been rare.","Hematologic disease"

CRC arises from the colorectal epithelium as a result of the accumulation of genetic alterations in defined oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes (TSG). Two major mechanisms of genomic instability have been identified in sporadic CRC progression. The first, known as chromosomal instability (CIN), results from a series of genetic changes that involve the activation of oncogenes such as K-ras and inactivation of TSG such as p53, DCC/Smad4, and APC. The second, known as microsatellite instability (MSI), results from inactivation of the DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1 and/or MSH2 by hypermethylation of their promoter, and secondary mutation of genes with coding microsatellites, such as transforming growth factor receptor II (TGF-RII) and BAX. Hereditary syndromes have germline mutations in specific genes (mutation in the tumour suppressor gene APC on chromosome 5q in FAP, mutated DNA mismatch repair genes in HNPCC).","Cancer"

"H01596","Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome","The Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is an autoimmune disease of neuromuscular transmission in which autoantibodies against the P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) at the presynaptic nerve terminal play a major role in decreasing quantal release of acetylcholine (ACh). Clinically, LEMS patients suffer from characteristic muscle weakness and autonomic symptoms. The underlying cause of LEMS in slightly more than half of all patients is small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) [DS:H00013]. The nerve terminal and carcinoma cells apparently share a common antigen (VGCC), suggesting an immunological cross-reactivity that may lead to the neurological abnormality. Cancer therapy is the priority for these patients. As for the remaining cases, no antibodies to P/Q-type VGCCs have been found in 10-15% of patients with LEMS. The fact that these seronegative patients positively respond to immunotherapy leads to the presumption that antibodies to other proteins might play a role in LEMS. Diagnosis of LEMS is ascertained on the basis of clinical symptoms and is further supported by electrophysiological and serological tests. The clinical triad in LEMS consists of weakness predominantly affecting proximal muscle groups, autonomic dysfunctions, and areflexia. Besides oncological treatment in case of case of SCLC-LEMS, treatment is based on symptomatic and semi-specific immunosuppressive therapy.","Nervous system disease; Immune system disease"

Autosomal-dominant and -recessive forms of dRTA are caused by mutations in ion transporters of the acid-secreting Type A intercalated cell of the renal collecting duct. These include the AE1 Cl-/HCO3- exchanger of the basolateral membrane and at least two subunits of the apical membrane vacuolar (v)H+-ATPase, the V1 subunit B1 (associated with deafness) and the V0 subunit a4.","Urinary system disease"
"H01358","Atopic dermatitis","Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a relapsing chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by eczematous skin lesions and intense pruritus. A genetic defect in the filaggrin (FLG) protein and/or environmental factors are thought to cause AD by disrupting the epidermis. This disruption, in turn, results in contact between immune cells in the dermis and antigens from the external environment leading to intense itching, scratching, and inflammation. Apart from FLG, recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified many susceptibility loci of atopic dermatitis with genome-wide significance.","Immune system disease"

Patients have variable hypogammaglobulinemia but typically have profound reduction or absence of two or more Ig isotypes. This leads to severe immunodeficiency and death due to infection often before adulthood. Deficiencies of B-cell receptors are caused by mutations in the genes that encode immunoglobulin heavy or light chains or their associated signaling molecules, leading to agammaglobulinemia or hypogammaglobulinemia. Mutations in immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes (such as gamma1, 2, 3, or 4; alpha1 or 2; and epsilon) cause deficiencies of individual classes or subclasses of immunoglobulins, but circulating B cells are present and overall antibody function is usually normal. Mutations in the kappa light-chain gene result in a population of immunoglobulin molecules with only lambda light chains instead of the usual mixture of kappa and lambda types.","Primary immunodeficiency"

"H01703","Eating Disorders","Eating disorders, which include anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge eating disorder (BED), are disorders defined by disturbances in eating behavior. Anorexia nervosa (AN) is the oldest recognized eating disorder. The salient features of this eating disorder are a relentless pursuit of thinness, accompanied by a fear of becoming fat despite being markedly underweight. In women, anorexia nervosa is associated with global endocrine dysregulation, including hypothalamic-pituitary axis dysfunction and alterations in adipokine and appetite regulating hormone levels. Bulimia nervosa (BN) is defined by eating behaviors that include episodes of binge eating which are followed by recurrent self-induced vomiting performed in an attempt to avoid weight gain from the caloric overload. Binge eating disorder (BED) is currently characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating occurring at least twice a week for 6 months or longer. In contrast to bulimia nervosa, there are no inappropriate compensatory behaviors such as vomiting. Eating disorders frequently develop during adolescence or early adulthood, but some studies have reported their onset during childhood or later in adulthood. There is growing evidence supporting a multifactorial etiology that includes genetic, neurochemical, and physiological components for eating disorders above and beyond the more conventional theories based on psychological and sociocultural factors. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a critical role in regulating nerves in the brain. Recent studies have provided evidence that BDNF also plays a role in regulating eating behaviors. In addition, an association between the BDNF gene polymorphism and eating disorders has been demonstrated. Other genetic risk factors for eating disorders has also been reported.","Mental and behavioural disorder"

"H01509","Tonsillar cancer","Tonsillar cancer (TC) is the most common oropharyngeal cancer and tumours are mainly squamous cell carcinomas. Traditionally, risk factors for the development of TC include the use of alcohol and/or tobacco, however a significant proportion of new cases develop in young patients without these risk factors. Recent investigation suggests that human papilloma virus (HPV) may serve as an etiology in such cases and represent a unique risk factor in a sub-set of patients. Compared with HPV-negative TC, HPV-positive TC showed a strong association with p16 overexpression, and an inverse association with EGFR amplification. HPV-16 integration status was strongly associated with c-myc amplification and HIF-1a overexpression. HPV-16 integration could be directly related to tonsillar carcinogenesis initially in tonsillar crypts, followed by cell cycle aberration such as p16 overexpression related to the G1-S phase.","Cancer"

"H02181","Idiopathic hyperCKemia","Persistent elevation of serum creatine kinase (hyperCKemia) in individuals with normal neurological and laboratory examinations has been called idiopathic hyperCKemia. HyperCKemia usually accompanies muscle weakness in patients with myopathies, but it may also be found in subjects with a normal neurological examination. This condition is labeled asymptomatic or isolated hyperCKemia and may be due to subclinical or preclinical neuromuscular disorders, dystrophinopathy carrier state, hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, alcoholism, or intake of statins and other drugs. When the cause is not found, even after extensive investigations, the condition is defined as idiopathic hyperCKemia. Mutations in the human CAV3 gene, leading to reduced expression of caveolin-3, which is the major muscle-specific caveolar protein, may result in hyperCKemia.","Congenital disorder of metabolism"
"H01704","Sudden sensorineural hearing loss","Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is commonly defined as hearing loss of more than 30 dB, affecting three or more frequencies, arising over less than 3 days. The predominant form of sudden SNHL is unilateral in location, and the main aetiology is idiopathic. As the majority of patients (30-65 %) with unilateral sudden SNHL report spontaneous recovery within 2 weeks, unilateral disease is mostly regarded as a benign condition. Prognosis for recovery is dependent on a number of factors, including patient age, presence of vertigo at onset, degree of hearing loss, and time between onset of hearing loss and treatment. The pathology of sudden SNHL remains unclear. However, a series of factors, including viral infections, microcirculatory disorders, autoimmune disorders, and labyrinthine hemorrhage, have been proposed as causative factors. Different treatment regimens like antioxidants, corticosteroids, vasodilatators, hyperbaric oxygen (HBO), or carbogen therapy have been described. Among these approaches, steroid treatment is the most common.","Nervous system disease"

Primary glioblastomas develop in older patients and typically show genetic alterations (EGFR amplification, p16/INK4a deletion, and PTEN mutations) at frequencies of 24-34%. Secondary glioblastomas develop in younger patients and frequently show overexpression of PDGF and CDK4 as well as p53 mutations (65%) and loss of Rb playing major roles in such transformations. Loss of PTEN has been implicated in both pathways, although it is much more common in the pathogenesis of primary GBM.","Cancer"

Originally this group consisted of four diseases: fundus albipunctatus, fundus flavimaculatus, familial drusen and fleck retina of Kandori. Doyne honeycomb degeneration of retina (DHRD) and Basal laminar drusen (BLD) are included in familial drusen. However, there are far more diseases with fleck-like deposits in the retina, including primary hereditary ocular diseases such as retinitis punctata albescens (RPA) or Bietti's crystalline dystrophy (BCD), neuro-ophthalmologic syndromes such as Kjellin's syndrome, and secundary retinal flecks due to metabolic disorders.","Nervous system disease"
"H00019","Pancreatic cancer","Infiltrating ductal adenocarcinoma is the most common malignancy of the pancreas. When most investigators use the term 'pancreatic cancer' they are referring to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Normal duct epithelium progresses to infiltrating cancer through a series of histologically defined precursors (PanINs). The overexpression of HER-2/neu and activating point mutations in the K-ras gene occur early, inactivation of the p16 gene at an intermediate stage, and the inactivation of p53, SMAD4, and BRCA2 occur relatively late. Activated K-ras engages multiple effector pathways. Although EGF receptors are conventionally regarded as upstream activators of RAS proteins, they can also act as RAS signal transducers via RAS-induced autocrine activation of the EGFR family ligands. Moreover, PDA shows extensive genomic instability and aneuploidy. Telomere attrition and mutations in p53 and BRCA2 are likely to contribute to these phenotypes. Inactivation of the SMAD4 tumour suppressor gene leads to loss of the inhibitory influence of the transforming growth factor-beta signalling pathway.","Cancer"
"H02118","Agnathia-otocephaly complex","Otocephaly, also referred to as agnathia-otocephaly complex, is an extremely rare lethal anomalad characterized by mandibular hypoplasia or agnathia, ventromedial auricular malposition (melotia) and/or auricular fusion (synotia), and microstomia with oroglossal hypoplasia or aglossia. The etiologic causes of otocephaly can be distinctly classified as a consequence of genetic and teratogenic factors. Recently, molecular genetic studies led to the identification of a loss of function genetic mutation in the PRRX1 gene. Teratogenic factors include smoking, alcohol usage, or even an exposure to radiation can increase the risk. In addition, other chemicals/drugs like streptonigrin antibiotics, trypan blue, theophylline, beclomethasone, salicylates, amidopyrine, mycophenolate, and phenytoin may increase the risk among pregnancies.","Congenital malformation"

"H00021","Renal cell carcinoma","Renal cell cancer (RCC) accounts for ~3% of human malignancies and its incidence appears to be rising. Although most cases of RCC seem to occur sporadically, an inherited predisposition to renal cancer accounts for 1-4% of cases. RCC is not a single disease, it has several morphological subtypes. Conventional RCC (clear cell RCC) accounts for ~80% of cases, followed by papillary RCC (10-15%), chromophobe RCC (5%), and collecting duct RCC (<1%). Genes potentially involved in sporadic neoplasms of each particular type are VHL, MET, BHD, and FH respectively. In the absence of VHL, hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF-alpha) accumulates, leading to production of several growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor. Activated MET mediates a number of biological effects including motility, invasion of extracellular matrix, cellular transformation, prevention of apoptosis and metastasis formation. Loss of functional FH leads to accumulation of fumarate in the cell, triggering inhibition of HPH and preventing targeted pVHL-mediated degradation of HIF-alpha. BHD mutations cause the Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome and its associated chromophobe, hybrid oncocytic, and conventional (clear cell) RCC.","Cancer"
"H02312","Glutathione synthetase deficiency","Glutathione synthetase deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder.

These symptoms occur predominantly at rest and worsen at night, resulting in nocturnal insomnia and chronic sleep deprivation. The prevalence of RLS increases with age and appears to be higher among women than among men. RLS has a high familial aggregation. To date, several loci and genetic risk factors have been identified, but no causative gene mutation has been found. Standard medications for RLS are dopamine agonists and CACN alpha-2 delta blocker. A high prevalence of iron deficiency has been found among patients with RLS. It has been reported that treatment with oral iron supplements resulted in improvements in the severity of the symptoms in patients with a low serum ferritin level.","Nervous system disease"

"H01563","HIV infection","The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes HIV infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Two types of HIV has been characterized. HIV-1 is the most virulent and pathogenic strain. Worldwide, the predominant virus is HIV-1. The relatively uncommon HIV-2 type is concentrated in West Africa and is rarely found elsewhere. Infection with HIV occurs by transfer of blood, semen, and breast milk. The identification of HIV as the causative agent of AIDS catalyzed efforts to develop antiviral agents. The licenced anti-HIV drugs fall into some categories: reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs), integrase inhibitors, protease inhibitors (PIs), fusion inhibitors (FIs), and coreceptor inhibitors. The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) as the standard of care for the treatment of HIV infection was seminal in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection and progression to AIDS. Combination antiretroviral therapy dramatically suppresses HIV replication and reduces the plasma HIV-1 viral load, resulting in significant reconstitution of the immune system.","Infectious disease"

Whereas ESCC can be attributed to alcohol and tobacco consumption, the most important risk factor for the development of EAC is duodenal-gastric-esophageal reflux. In the process of tumorigenesis at the cellular level, multiple genetic alterations are involved, including mutation of the p53 gene, amplification of cyclin D1 gene, among others.","Cancer"

"H01555","Merkel cell carcinoma","Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a cutaneous neuroendocrine malignancy that exhibits clinically aggressive features and is associated with a poor prognosis. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation may be a cause, and corresponds with the sites of these tumours, often on sun-exposed skin, mostly (94%) in the White population. UV light may exert local immunomodulating action as it decreases amount of epidermal T cells and Langerhans cells, inducing hapten tolerance. Additionally, UV- specific mutations in TP53 and Harvey (Ha)-RAS genes are present in some MCC cell lines. Recently, the polyomavirus group has been linked with MCC. The MCC polyomavirus (MCPyV) has been isolated from MCC tissue and thought to be present in up to 80% of MCC. Tumorigenesis likely is caused by a number of sequential steps from viral integration into host DNA, mutagenic events, and specific immune responses.","Cancer"
"H01767","Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis","Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis (HSPN) is a rare kidney disease leading to chronic kidney disease in a non-negligible percentage of patients. Generally, the prognosis of Henoch-Schonlein purpura [DS:H01584] in children is favorable, but there are severe complications, one of which is renal involvement. HSPN is mainly characterized by acute episodes of glomerular inflammation with endocapillary and mesangial proliferation, fibrin deposits, and epithelial crescents that can heal spontaneously or lead to chronic lesions. HSPN and IgA nephropathy [DR:H01581] are currently considered related diseases resulting from glomerular deposition of aberrantly glycosylated IgA1. Although both nephritides present with similar histological findings and IgA abnormalities, they display pathophysiological differences with important therapeutic implications. Although there have been few evidence-based treatment strategies for HSPN, several studies have suggested that immunosuppressive drugs and multiple drug combination therapy were effective in ameliorating proteinuria and histological severity.","Immune system disease; Urinary system disease"
"H00814","Vitelliform macular dystrophy","Vitelliform macular dystrophy is characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance and autofluorescent deposits within and beneath the retinal pigment epithelium.

"H00028","Choriocarcinoma","Gestational choriocarcinoma is a highly malignant epithelial tumor that can be associated with any type of gestational event, most often a complete hydatidiform mole (CM). CM occur in about one per 1000 pregnancies, and about 5-20% of CM progress to invasive moles or choriocarcinoma. Several molecular studies have been done to establish the expression of tumor-associated proteins in choriocarcinoma. In the p53 pathway, overexpression of the p53 protein and the p53-associated protein, MDM2, have been detected. Synergistic upregulation of c-MYC, c-ERB-2, c-FMS, and BCL-2 oncoproteins have also been suggested to have an important role in the pathogenesis of choriocarcinoma. Moreover, choriocarcinomas have been shown to express increased concentrations of MMP and decreased concentrations of TIMP to help with tumor invasion and metastasis.","Cancer"
"H02129","Prune belly syndrome","Prune belly syndrome (PBS) is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by deficient or absent abdominal wall musculature, hypotonia, ectasia of the urinary system, and bilateral intra-abdominal testes. A homozygous loss-of-function mutation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 (CHRM3) has been described from patients with a PBS-like syndrome. CHRM3 encodes the major receptor mediating urinary bladder contraction upon micturition.","Other disease"
"H01758","Relapsing polychondritis","Relapsing polychondritis (RP) is a rare multisystemic disease widely accepted as a complex autoimmune disorder affecting proteoglycan-rich structures and cartilaginous tissues, including the ear, nose, larynx, trachea, bronchi, peripheral joints, eye, heart, and skin, with high risk of misdiagnosis. The clinical spectrum may vary from intermittent inflammatory episodes leading to unesthetic structural deformities to life-threatening cardiopulmonary manifestations, such as airway collapse and valvular regurgitation. The diagnosis of RP is largely based on the clinical features and the role of laboratory investigations is purely supportive and to rule out other related or associated systemic diseases. Treatment in RP is largely symptomatic and a standard management protocol is yet to be established due to its rarity.","Musculoskeletal disease; Skin and connective tissue disease"
"H01932","Ablepharon-macrostomia syndrome","Ablepharon-macrostomia syndrome (AMS) is a rare autosomal dominant condition characterized by absent eyelids, absent eyebrows and eyelashes, macrostomia, and external ear abnormalities. It has been reported that AMS is due to mutations in TWIST2.","Congenital malformation"
"H01760","Hepatic glycogen storage disease","Glycogen storage diseases (GSD) are inherited metabolic disorders of glycogen metabolism. They are divided into types 0 to XV, according to enzyme or transporter deficiency and organ distribution. The hepatic GSDs lead to hepatomegaly and hypoglycemia due to the lack of distribution of glucose to the organism. 80% of hepatic GSD is formed by types I, III, and IX. GSD I involves the liver, kidney and intestine, and the clinical manifestations are hepatomegaly, failure to thrive, hypoglycemia, hyperlactatemia, hyperuricemia and hyperlipidemia. GSD IIIa patients display symptoms and signs due to the enzyme deficiency in liver, skeletal muscle and heart, whereas the remaining patients with GSD IIIb have only liver-related phenotypes. GSD IV usually presents in the first year of life, with hepatomegaly and growth retardation. GSD VI and IX are caused by a deficiency of the liver phosphorylase and phosphorylase kinase system, and with usually moderate symptoms which manifest mainly in childhood.","Inherited metabolic disease; Liver disease"
"H00480","X-linked mental retardation","X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) is an inherited condition that causes failure to develop cognitive abilities because of mutations in several genes on the X chromosome. XLMR is subdivided into syndromic and non-syndromic forms (NS-XLMR), depending on whether further abnormalities are found on physical examination, laboratory investigation and brain imaging. The majority of genes that are mutated in NS-XLMR encode proteins are involved in three distinct pathways: Rho GTPases pathway modulating neuronal differentiation and synaptic plasticity; Rab GTPases pathway regulating synaptic vesicle cycling; gene expression regulation.","Mental and behavioural disorder"
"H01552","Down syndrome","Down syndrome (DS), a genetic condition characterized by mental retardation and distinctive facial appearance, is caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 (HSA21). Down syndrome (DS) is the most common chromosomal malformation in newborns. Throughout the world, the overall prevalence of DS is 1 per 1,000 live births, although in recent years this figure has been increasing. Roughly 95% of cases of DS are due to the presence of an extra (third) copy of HSA21. Most often, the non-disjunction event leading to DS occurs in maternal meiosis I. In about 5% of patients, 1 copy is translocated to another acrocentric chromosome, most often chromosome 14 or 21. In 2 to 4% of cases with free trisomy 21 there is recognizable mosaicism for a trisomic and a normal cell line. DS occurs at a much higher incidence in older mothers. Nonetheless, the vast majority of DS births are to younger mothers. Clinical and experimental studies have shown that age independent DNA hypo-methylation is associated with chromosomal instability and abnormal segregation. Recent studies have linked the increased frequency of polymorphism of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and methionine synthase gene (MTRR) in mothers with DS child. The phenotypic features of DS are quite variable from person to person and include learning disability, heart defects, early-onset Alzheimer's disease and childhood leukaemia. This phenotypic variation is likely to be caused by a combination of environmental and genetic causes. Genetic polymorphisms in both Hsa21 and non-Hsa21 genes may account for much of this variation. Trisomy of Hsa21 has a significant impact on the development of many tissues, most notably the heart and the brain. A recent paper has suggested that RCAN1 and DYRK1A, localized in the Down syndrome critical region (DSCR) of HSA21, may have an impact on the development of multiple tissues.","Chromosomal abnormality"
"H01136","Carboxypeptidase N deficiency","Carboxypeptidase N (CPN) is a plasma zinc metalloprotease that inactivates C3a, C4a, C5a, bradykinin, kalladin, and fibrinopeptides. CPN has been implicated as a major regulator of inflammation. Although deficiency of CPN produces a severe allergic syndrome, there are no reported cases of complete deficiency of CPN in humans. There are a few documented cases of partial CPN deficiency. Patients present some combination of angioedema or chronic urticaria, as well as hay fever or asthma. It has been reported that mutations in CPN1, which encodes the catalytic subunit of CPN, cause CPN deficiency.","Immune system disease"

"H00010","Multiple myeloma","Multiple myeloma is a disorder in which malignant plasma cells accumulate, generally derived from one clone in the bone marrow. Intricate interactions occur between the bone-marrow microenvironment and the myeloma cells, frequently causing bone destruction, which in turn stimulates tumor growth. Often it is preceded by a premalignant tumor called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Multiple oncogenic events have been identified that have contributed to the pathogenesis of myeloma. Among the earliest genetic events are translocations of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene locus, which leads to dysregulation of oncogenes at translocation partner regions (cyclin D1 at 11q13, FGFR3/MMSET at 4p16.3, c-MAF at 16q23, and cyclin D3 at 6p21), and deletions of 13q14, the site of a putative tumor suppressor gene. Additional molecular events include epigenetic changes and activation of oncogenes (mutations of N-RAS and K-RAS, and changes in c-MYC), which are usually associated with disease progression.","Cancer"
"H00222","Afibrinogenemia","Congenital fibrinogen defects caused by mutation of any of fibrinogen genes (FGA, FGB, and FGG) include both quantitative defects (type I deficiencies or afibrinogenemia) and qualitative defects (type II deficiencies or dysfibrinogenemia).

GPS and Say-Barber-Biesecker-Young-Simpson syndrome (SBBYSS) [DS:H01793] are clinically similar disorders with some overlapping features. They were found to be caused by de novo truncating sequence variants in the KAT6B (histone acetyltransferase) gene, strongly suggesting that they are allelic disorders. In GPS, the overall clinical picture tends to be more severe than in SBBYSS. Features present only in GPS are contractures, anomalies of the spine, ribs and pelvis, renal cysts, hydronephrosis, and agenesis of the corpus callosum. Thyroid abnormalities have been reported in rare cases.","Congenital malformation"

"H01599","Hypereosinophilic syndrome","Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a heterogeneous group of rare disorders characterized by marked blood or tissue eosinophilia resulting in a wide variety of clinical manifestations. A number of HES subtypes, or variants, have recently been identified. The best characterized of the clonal molecular defects implicated in myeloproliferative variant HES is the 800-kb interstitial deletion on chromosome 4q12 resulting in the fusion of 2 distinct genes, Fip1-like 1 (FIP1L1) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-a (PDGFRA), leading to the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion kinase. PDGFR is a membrane-bound tyrosine kinase receptor and the fusion PDGFRA kinase has constitutive/unregulated tyrosine kinase activity. The lymphocytic HES variant is associated with T-cell clones producing interleukin-5 (IL-5) and can evolve into lymphoma. While myeloproliferative and lymphocytic HES are well established and permit elimination of the term, idiopathic, to these varieties, most HES patients do not fall into these categories and are classified as complex.","Cancer"

HE most commonly occurs in decompensated liver cirrhosis and incorporates a spectrum of manifestations that ranges from mild cognitive impairment to coma. Although its pathogenesis is not entirely understood, one of the main factors is thought to be ammonia. Apart from hyperammonemia, various other pathogenic mechanisms, such as the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) theory, the benzodiazepine theory, the manganese theory, and the theory of oxidative/nitrosative stress, have been implicated in the development of HE. The pharmacological treatments that are currently used in clinical practice are directed toward reducing the production and absorption of gut-derived ammonia.","Nervous system disease; Digestive system disease"

Several isoforms of NRAMP2 (SLC11A2) are expressed ubiquitously in recycling endosomes or specifically at the apical membrane of epithelial cells in intestine and kidneys, and can contribute to iron overload, whereas mutations impairing NRAMP2 function cause a form of congenital hypochromic microcytic anemia.","Hematologic disease"
"H00044","Cancer of the anal canal","Squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal accounts for 1.5 per cent of all digestive system cancers in the USA, with an estimated 4,660 new cases and 660 deaths in 2006. Epidemiological and molecular-biology studies have now shown that sexually transmitted infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most important aetiological agent. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is also associated with anal cancer. HPV infection is transient in most immunocompetent individuals, but HIV-positive patients have evidence of persistent HPV infection within the anal canal. Current data suggest that mutations in p53, DCC and APC tumor suppressor genes contribute to the stepwise progression of anal squamous cell carcinoma in immunocompetent individuals.","Cancer"

"H00420","Familial partial lipodystrophy","Familial partial lipodystrophy (FPL) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by variable loss of body fat from the extremities as well as from the truncal region. LMNA, PPARG and AKT2 have been identified in association with FPL. However, it is not yet known how these genes cause the disorder. Besides them, additional loci are likely as many FPL patients do not reveal any mutations in these genes. LMNA mutations may affect nuclear function, and may be involved in apoptosis and premature cell death of adipocytes, thus causing lipodystrophy. PPARG, PLIN1, and AKT2 are regulators of adipocyte differentiation. AKT2 is also involved in postreceptor insulin signaling. Thus, mutations in these three genes could result in lipodystrophy. The reason why loss of fat is restricted to partial areas remains unknown. Recently, novel autosomal recessive causes of partial lipodystrophy were reported.","Congenital disorder of metabolism"

"H00081","Hashimoto thyroiditis","Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) is a common form of chronic autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), and is characterized by an inflammatory infiltrate of immunocytes that replace the parenchyma and induce thyroid enlargement, which eventually leads to gland fibrosis. Progressive thyrocyte depletion results in impaired thyroid hormone production and clinical hypothyroidism, a condition that involves a marked reduction of metabolic activity in various cells and tissues. AITDs are regarded as polygenic disorders resulting from the combination of a genetic predisposition in conjunction with an environmental trigger. Two main approaches have been employed to locate susceptibility loci for AITD, namely case control candidate gene studies and genome-wide linkage screens. Case control candidate gene studies have been employed to investigate numerous genes for association with AITD, but to date, only the human leucocyte region (HLA) on chromosome 6p21 and the cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated 4 (CTLA-4) gene on chromosome 2q33 have been consistently shown to be associated with disease.","Immune system disease"
