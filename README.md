# Introduction

  

  

This repository contains code and data for my article "[Neo4j forÂ Diseases](https://towardsdatascience.com/neo4j-for-diseases-959dffb5b479)".

1. The scripts are for data processing.

  

2. The data folder contains the five CSV to be imported into Neo4j.

  

  

# Prerequisite

Neo4j Desktop
  

# Run


  
1. Download the KEGG data with its API
```console
python download_various_kegg.py ds [kegg_download_folder]
```
 
2. Generate nodes and edges
```console
python parse_disease.py [kegg_download_folder]
```
3. Add taxonomy to pathogen. In step 2, a file called pathogen_tmp.csv is generated. We need to add the taxonomy to it via:

```console
python add_taxonomy.py pathogen_tmp.csv > pathogen.csv
```

4. Put all the CSV files, except pathogen_tmp.csv, into the Import folder of your Neo4j project. And then follow the instruction in the article.
